All Praises are for Allāh, the Lord of all worlds, and I send blessings and
peace upon the one sent as a mercy to the worlds, our Prophet Muḥammad, and upon
his family and all his companions.

I have reviewed what our brother Shaykh ʿAbd\ Allāh ibn Aḥmad al-Ḥuwayl has
written in his book titled *al-Tawḥīd al-Muyassar* and I was really pleased
seeing the ease and simplicity he brought to this noble knowledge. Making things
easy for the learner is one of the objectives of the Sharīʿah. That is why Allāh
says, «Indeed We have made the Quran easy for seeking advice. So, is there one
to heed to the advice?» (al-Qamar, Q54:17). The Prophet \BPBUH said, as reported
by Abū Hurayrah in an authentic ḥadīth, «You were sent to make things easy, not
to make things difficult.» He also said as is reported by Jābir in *Ṣaḥīḥ
Muslim*, «Allāh did not send me to be harsh, or cause harm, but He has sent me
to teach and make things easy.»

This blessed Sharīʿah is built on ease in both its knowledge and practice, which
is the case for most matters and is meant for all people.

Our brother Shaykh ʿAbd\ Allāh has done a commendable work, especially by
simplifying and making accessible the foundational knowledge which is the
knowledge of Tawḥīd, through which a servant learns the right of Allāh upon him,
which rectifies his affairs both in this world and in the Hereafter.

I ask Allāh to grant us and him ability and righteousness to do good in word and
deed, and to benefit from this blessed effort.

Praise be to Allāh, the Lord of all worlds, and I send blessings and peace upon
the one sent as a mercy to the worlds, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family
and all his companions.

After that, I reviewed what our brother Shaykh ʿAbd\ Allāh ibn Aḥmad al-Ḥuwayl
wrote in his book entitled *al-Tawḥīd al-Muyassar*. I was pleased with the ease
and simplicity he brought to this important knowledge. Making things easy for
learners is one of the goals of Sharia. The Prophet \BPBUH said, “You were sent
to make things easy, not to make things difficult.”

This blessed Sharīʿah is built on ease in both its knowledge and practice, which
suits its universality. It is meant for all people. Our brother Shaykh ʿAbd\
Allāh has done commendable work, especially in simplifying and making accessible
the foundational science of monotheism, through which a person learns the right
of Allāh, which brings success in both this world and the Hereafter.

I ask Allāh to grant us and him success and guidance in word and deed, and to
benefit from this blessed effort.

All praises or for Allah the Lord of the worlds, may peace and blessings
be upon our prophet Mohammed, his family and his companions all
together.

I have come across the book namely "Altawheed Almuyassar", written by
our brother Abdullah Bin Ahmed Alhuwayl, and it gave me immense pleasure
to see how this great topic (of tawheed) was made easy and simple to
understand, for verily making things easy for the learner is from the
objectives of the religion. That is why Allah says : "And We have indeed
made the Qur\'an easy to understand and remember; then is there any that
will remember" Surah Qamar verse 22. The prophet (ﷺ) in one authentic
hadith said as reported by Abu Hurairah : "You have been sent to make
things easy (for the people), you have not been sent to make things
difficult for them." The prophet (ﷺ) also said as reported by Jaabir in
sahih muslim : "Allah did not send me to be harsh or cause harm, but He
has sent me to teach and make things easy".

Thus the foundation of this Blessed legislation (shariah) is based on
making things easy in knowledge, in action and in general every thing.
And it is for people all together.

And what our brother Abdullah Bin Ahmed Alhuwayl has come with is a
really good deed over which he should be thanked. Especially what he has
done in terms of facilitating and bringing together the foundation of
all knowledge which is the knowledge of Tauheed, through which a slave
learns about the rights of Allah, with which amendment of this world and
the next is achieved.

I ask Allah to grant us and him ability to do good and steadfastness in
what we say and do, and ask Him to make this blessed effort beneficial. -->
