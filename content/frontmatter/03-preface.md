# Preface {.unnumbered}

All praises belong to Allāh, Lord of the worlds, and may peace and blessings be
upon the last and the final Prophet and Messenger Muhammad, and his family and
companions all together.

This is a brief beneficial summary, and collection of comprehensive affairs,
nice benefits related to the concept of At-Tawheed without which no acts are
accepted by Allāh, nor is He pleased with a slave except by its
correctness/establishment.

I penned down this short treatise...

A thing cannot be known unless two affairs are made clear:

1. Its reality

2. And clarifying its opposite

I tried to clarify the true meaning of At-Tawheed and mention its
foundations and categories, after which I went on to mention the
opposite of it which is AlShirk, to inform and clarify through it its
different forms and types because:

This is because the beauty of tawheed and its virtues will not become
apparent except by knowing the ugliness and dangers of AlShirk. For this
work, I have also accumulated other important topics which a monotheist
shouldn't be ignorant of.

I made every effort in ordering the topics, their arrangement and division, I
took care of hudood and the definitions while citing evidences briefly to make
this work, easy to memorize and understand.

I refrained from being lengthy as well as too concise and made this work between
these two conditions. If I am correct, then it is from of Allāh. If I have made
any mistakes, then it is from me and the Shaitan

I have gathered this work from the books of righteous scholars, and I have named
it *al-Tawḥīd al-Muyassar* asking the Almighty to make it beneficial and put it
in the scale of my good deeds.

May peace and blessings be upon our prophet Mohammed his family and his
companions.
