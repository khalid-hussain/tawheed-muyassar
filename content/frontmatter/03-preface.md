# Preface {.unnumbered}

All praises are for Allāh the Lord of all worlds, and blessings and peace be
upon the last of the prophets and messengers, our Prophet Muḥammad, and upon his
family and all his companions.

This is a beneficial summary, containing comprehensive issues and useful
insights, on the subject of Tawḥīd, without which Allāh does not accept any
deed, and is not pleased with a servant except by its realization.

I have written this brief summary which includes guidelines, rules, and
categories that help the reader gather scattered information, capture key
points, and organize the knowledge in their mind. Since a thing is not known
unless two matters are understood:

1. Its reality; and
2. Its opposite.

I have made an effort to clarify the reality of Tawheed, outlining its
fundamentals and categories . Then, I addressed its opposite, which is shirk
(associating others with Allāh), explaining its forms, types, and rulings
because:

"Things become clear through their opposites, and the beauty of one is
highlighted by the ugliness of the other."

The beauty and virtue of Tawheed only truly appears by understanding the
ugliness and dangers of shirk. I have also included other important topics in
this booklet that are essential for anyone practicing monotheist to know.

I have strived to organize and categorize the issues carefully, focusing on
definitions and boundaries while providing evidences and references in a concise
manner to make this summary easy to memorize and understand.

I avoided lengthy elaboration and insufficient brevity, aiming for a balance
between the two. If I have succeeded, it is by the grace of Allāh alone; if I
have erred, it is from myself and Satan.

I have compiled this summary from the books of monotheistic scholars and named
it "AlTawheed AlMuyassar," asking the Almighty to make it beneficial and place
it in the scale of my good deeds on the Day I meet Him.

May Allāh bless and grant peace to our Prophet Muhammad and his family and
companions.

------------------------

All praises belong to Allāh, Lord of the worlds, and may peace and blessings be
upon the last and the final Prophet and Messenger Muhammad, and his family and
companions all together.

This is a brief beneficial summary, and collection of comprehensive affairs,
nice benefits related to the concept of At-Tawheed without which no acts are
accepted by Allāh, nor is He pleased with a slave except by its
correctness/establishment.

I penned down this short treatise...

A thing cannot be known unless two affairs are made clear:

1. Its reality

2. And clarifying its opposite

I tried to clarify the true meaning of At-Tawheed and mention its
foundations and categories, after which I went on to mention the
opposite of it which is AlShirk, to inform and clarify through it its
different forms and types because:

This is because the beauty of tawheed and its virtues will not become
apparent except by knowing the ugliness and dangers of AlShirk. For this
work, I have also accumulated other important topics which a monotheist
shouldn't be ignorant of.

I made every effort in ordering the topics, their arrangement and division, I
took care of hudood and the definitions while citing evidences briefly to make
this work, easy to memorize and understand.

I refrained from being lengthy as well as too concise and made this work between
these two conditions. If I am correct, then it is from of Allāh. If I have made
any mistakes, then it is from me and the Shaitan

I have gathered this work from the books of righteous scholars, and I have named
it *al-Tawḥīd al-Muyassar* asking the Almighty to make it beneficial and put it
in the scale of my good deeds.

May peace and blessings be upon our prophet Mohammed his family and his
companions.
