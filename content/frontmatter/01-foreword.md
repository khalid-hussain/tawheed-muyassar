Bismillahi Alrahmaani Alraheem

I praise Allah and thank Him, may peace and blessings be upon Muhammad,
his family, and companions.

I have read this treatise, which is titled "Altawheed almuyassar"
written by Shiekh Abdullah Bin Ahmad Alhuwayl, and found it an important
piece of writing containing the definition of Tawheed and worship and
its virtues and examples of different types of worship which befit none
but Allah. The author also mentioned some forms of Shirk and what
diminishes by Shirk affecting the reality of tawheed. Thus, I recommend
its printing, publishing, and distribution in places where different
forms of shirk take place because of ignorance and blind following, it
may be that Allah guides with it anyone who He wishes good for.

And may peace and blessings be upon our prophet Muhammad, his family and
his companions.
