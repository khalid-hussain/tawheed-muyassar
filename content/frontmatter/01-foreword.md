Bismillahi Alrahmaani Alraheem


I praise and thank Allāh, and I send blessings and peace upon Muhammad, his
family, and his companions.

I read this booklet titled "Al-tawheed al-muyassar" prepared by Shaykh ʿAbd\
Allāh ibn Aḥmad al-Ḥuwayl, and I found it to be a valuable resource. It contains
a definition of Tawheed, worship, and its virtues, examples of types of worship
that should only be directed to Allāh, and mentions some types of shirk
(associating others with Allāh) or what diminishes the realization of true
Tawhid. We recommend printing, publishing, and distributing it in countries that
have fallen into many types of shirk due to ignorance and blind following,
hoping that Allāh the Exalted will benefit those whom He wills good for.

And may peace and blessings be upon our prophet Muhammad, his family and
his companions.

I praise Allah and thank Him, may peace and blessings be upon Muhammad,
his family, and companions.

I have read this treatise, which is titled "Altawheed almuyassar"
written by Shiekh Abdullah Bin Ahmad Alhuwayl, and found it an important
piece of writing containing the definition of Tawheed and worship and
its virtues and examples of different types of worship which befit none
but Allah. The author also mentioned some forms of Shirk and what
diminishes by Shirk affecting the reality of tawheed. Thus, I recommend
its printing, publishing, and distribution in places where different
forms of shirk take place because of ignorance and blind following, it
may be that Allah guides with it anyone whom He wishes good for.

And may peace and blessings be upon our prophet Muhammad, his family and
his companions.
