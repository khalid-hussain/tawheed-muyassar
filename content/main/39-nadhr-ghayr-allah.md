Vowing (Nadhr) to Other Than Allah

Definition:
 • Linguistically: Obligation or commitment.
 • Islamically: It is when a responsible person binds themselves to perform an act of worship that was not obligatory upon them, as a form of reverence for the one to whom the vow is made.


Vowing is Worship for Allah Alone:

Know that vowing is an act of worship that must be directed only to Allah. Whoever makes a vow to anyone other than Allah has committed major shirk (polytheism).

Allah says:
“They fulfill their vows”
— [Surah Al-Insan, 76:7]

Whoever vows to other than Allah must not fulfill that vow, as it is impermissible.

When Does a Vow Become Shirk?

A vow becomes shirk when a person binds themselves to an action for someone other than Allah, intending reverence or closeness. Examples include:
 • Saying: “If Allah cures my patient, I will give such-and-such number of sheep or money to the grave of a certain saint.”
 • “If I have a child, I will slaughter at the shrine of a certain saint.”
 • “I vow to the saint or jinn that I will slaughter three animals.”
 • Vowing to idols.
 • Vowing to the sun or moon.
