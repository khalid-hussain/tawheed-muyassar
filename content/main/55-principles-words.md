Two Beneficial Principles Regarding Speech

1. The obligation to guard the tongue from forbidden speech:
This includes backbiting, gossip, and lying.
Also included is speech that involves shirk (associating partners with Allah), such as swearing by something other than Allah. This is because a person is accountable for every word they utter, as Allah says:
“Not a word does he utter but there is an observer near him, ready (to record it).”
[Qāf: 18]
A person may even exit Islam with a single word they speak—so one must be careful and precise in their words.
 2. Words and phrases that may imply shirk:
It is not permissible to use expressions that could potentially involve shirk, because using them may lead to it or open the door to it.
