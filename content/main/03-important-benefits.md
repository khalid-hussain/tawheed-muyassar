First, the three categories of tawḥīd are interconnected. Each of these
categories cannot be separated from the other. So, if someone establishes only
one of the categories leaving the others, he won't be a monotheist.

Second, you should know that the polytheists who were fought by the Prophet used
to affirm tawḥīd of lordship. They used to acknowledge that Allāh was the
Creator and Provider, the Giver and Taker of life, the Causer of benefit and
harm, and the One in charge of all affairs. But even so, this belief did not
enter them into Islam. Allāh says,

Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Who owns
˹your˺ hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead
from the living? And who conducts every affair?” They will ˹surely˺ say,
“Allāh.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?” (Yūnus, Q10:31)

Third, tawḥīd of worship was the subject matter of the call of all the
Messengers. Because it is the foundation on which all deeds are based and
without its realization no deeds are valid. So when it is not established, its
opposite takes place, which is shirk. The main dispute between the Messengers
and their people was *this* tawḥīd, so it is necessary to look after it, teach
its details, and understand its principles.
