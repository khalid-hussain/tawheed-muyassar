Types of Kufr (Disbelief):

There are two types: Major Kufr (Kufr Akbar) and Minor Kufr (Kufr Asghar).

⸻

Major Kufr (Kufr Akbar)

   A. Definition: It is the denial of belief in Allah and His messengers — whether this is done through rejection, or simply by refusing to believe, even without outright denial.

   B. Ruling: It takes one out of the religion of Islam.

   C. Types of Major Kufr (Five Types):

      1. Kufr of Denial (Kufr al-Takdhib): This is the disbelief through rejecting and denying the truth. Evidence: Allah says: “And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about Allah or denies the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in Hell a home for the disbelievers?” [Surah Al-‘Ankabut, 29:68]

      2. Disbelief of Pride and Arrogance Despite Belief (Kufr al-Ibaa wal-Istikbaar ma‘a Tasdeeq)

   This is when someone knows the truth, believes it inwardly, but refuses to accept it out of arrogance. Evidence: Allah says: “And [mention] when We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate to Adam,’ and they prostrated, except for Iblis. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.” [Surah al-Baqarah, Q2:34]

   3. Disbelief of Doubt (Kufr al-Shakk) – Also Known as Disbelief of Suspicion (Kufr al-Zann)

      This is when a person is unsure or doubts the truth, even if it has been made
      clear. Evidence: Allah says: “He entered his garden while he was wronging
      himself. He said, ‘I do not think that this will perish – ever. And I do not
      think the Hour will occur. And even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I
      will surely find better than this as a return.’ His companion said to him while
      conversing, ‘Do you disbelieve in the One who created you from dust, then from a
      sperm-drop, and then fashioned you into a man? But as for me, He is Allah, my
      Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord.’” [Surah Al-Kahf, 18:35–38]

   4. Disbelief of Turning Away (Kufr al-I’raadh)

      This is when a person completely ignores the truth, showing no concern to know
      it or act upon it. Evidence: Allah says: “But those who disbelieve turn away
      from that of which they are warned.” [Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46:3]

   5. Disbelief of Hypocrisy (Kufr al-Nifaaq)

      This refers to pretending to believe outwardly, while disbelieving inwardly.
      Evidence: Allah says: “That is because they believed, then they disbelieved; so
      their hearts were sealed, and they do not understand.” [Surah Al-Munafiqun,
      63:3]


Minor Kufr (Lesser Disbelief)

A. Its definition: it refers to any act of disobedience described in the Quran
and Sunnah as kufr, but which does not reach the level of major disbelief that
takes a person out of Islam.

b. Its Ruling:
 • It is forbidden and considered a major sin, but it does not take a person out of the fold of Islam.

c. Examples of Minor Kufr:
 1. Ingratitude for blessings (Kufr al-Ni’mah):
 • Allah said:
“They denied the blessings of Allah.”
[Surah An-Nahl: 112]
 2. Fighting a fellow Muslim:
 • The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
“Insulting a Muslim is wickedness, and fighting him is disbelief (kufr).”
[Agreed upon – i.e., in both Bukhari and Muslim]
(Note: This is not kufr that expels one from Islam, but rather a serious sin.)
 3. Mocking or attacking people’s lineage (ancestry):
 • The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
“Two traits found among people are acts of kufr: attacking others’ lineage and wailing over the dead.”
[Narrated by Muslim]

4. Wailing over the dead (النياحة على الميت):
 • The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
“Two things found among people are acts of kufr: slandering ancestry and wailing over the dead.”
— [Narrated by Muslim]
