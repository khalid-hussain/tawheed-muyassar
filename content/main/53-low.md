The Word “لو” (If…)

The usage of this word has three categories:

1. Permissible Usage:

When “لو” is used merely as a statement of fact or information, without objection or regret.
Example:
“If you had attended the class, you would have benefited.”
(لو حضرت الدرس لاستفدت)
Evidence:
The saying of the Prophet ﷺ:
“If I had known beforehand what I came to know later, I would not have brought the sacrificial animal and would have performed Umrah with you.”
[Agreed upon – Bukhari & Muslim]

2. Recommended Usage (Mustahabb):

When “لو” is used in the context of wishing or hoping for good.
Example:
“If I had wealth, I would give in charity.”
(لو كان عندي مال لتصدقت به)
Evidence:
The Prophet ﷺ said regarding the story of four men, one of whom said:
“If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does.”
(meaning: he wished for the good deeds of the rich man).
So the Prophet ﷺ said:
“He is rewarded according to his intention; their reward is the same.”
[Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi]

3. Forbidden Usage (Prohibited):

When “لو” is used in any of the following three forms, it becomes prohibited:

a. In objection to religious rulings or divine will:
Example in the Qur’an:
“Had they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.”
[Surah Aal Imran, 3:168]

b. Objection to Divine Decree (Qadr):

Using “لو” to express dissatisfaction or resentment toward Allah’s decree.
Evidence – Qur’an:

“If they had been with us, they would not have died or been killed.”
[Surah Aal Imran, 3:156]

c. Wishing for Evil:

Using “لو” to wish for something sinful or harmful.
Example:
From the Hadith of the four men, one of them said:
“If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does” — referring to a man who spends wealth in sinful or evil ways.
The Prophet ﷺ replied:
“He will be judged according to his intention; their sin is the same.”
[Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi]
