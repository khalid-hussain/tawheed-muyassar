Visiting Graves

Visiting graves is divided into three categories:

1. Permissible (Legitimate) Visit:

This is the type of visit that is encouraged in Islam, and it includes:
 • a. To remember the Hereafter.
 • b. To greet the deceased.
 • c. To pray for them.

2. Innovative (Bid‘ah) Visit:

This type goes against the perfection of Tawhid (Islamic monotheism) and is a means leading to shirk (polytheism). Examples include:
 • a. Intentionally worshipping Allah at the grave.
 • b. Seeking blessings from the grave.
 • c. Donating rewards of good deeds at the grave.
 • d. Traveling specifically to visit the grave.
 • And other similar practices.
3. Polytheistic (Shirk) Visit (continued):

This type contradicts Tawhid (Islamic monotheism) and occurs when a person directs any act of worship to the one buried in the grave. Examples include:
 • a. Calling upon the dead instead of Allah (du‘ā’).
 • b. Seeking help (isti‘ānah) or relief (istighāthah) from them.
 • c. Slaughtering animals (sacrifice) or making vows (nadhr) for them.
 • And other similar acts.
