Intending Worldly Gain Through Acts of Worship

What is meant by this:
It is when a person performs a purely religious act with the intention of attaining a direct worldly benefit.

Examples of this include:
 • Performing Hajj to receive money.
 • Going out to fight (in jihad) only to gain war booty.
 • Calling the Adhan (call to prayer) to earn a salary.
 • Seeking Islamic knowledge solely for a certificate or a job.

Ruling:
This is divided into two cases:

A. If most or all of the person’s deeds are intended for worldly gain:
 This is major shirk (shirk akbar).

B. If a specific act is done with the intention of worldly benefit:
👉This is minor shirk (shirk asghar) and invalidates that specific deed.

Warning Against Seeking Worldly Gains Through Worship:
Allah says:

“Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments – We fully repay them for their deeds therein, and they will not be deprived.
They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire. And worthless is what they have done therein, and invalid is what they used to do.”
— [Surah Hud: 15-16]

The Prophet ﷺ said:

“Whoever learns knowledge that is (meant to be) sought for the sake of Allah’s Face, but he only learns it to gain some worldly benefit, will not even smell the fragrance of Paradise.”
— Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud
