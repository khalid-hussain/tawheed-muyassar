A Beneficial Du‘āʾ for Protection from Shirk:

From Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him), he said: The Messenger of Allah
(peace be upon him) once addressed us saying: “O people, beware of this shirk!
It is more hidden than the creeping of an ant.” Someone asked: “O Messenger of
Allah, how can we protect ourselves from it when it is more hidden than the
creeping of an ant?”

He said: “Say: O Allah, we seek refuge in You from associating anything with You
knowingly, and we seek Your forgiveness for what we do unknowingly.” [Narrated
by Ahmad and graded as good (hasan) by Al-Albani – may Allah have mercy on them
both.]
