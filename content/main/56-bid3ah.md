Innovation in Religion (Bid‘ah)

Definition:
 • Linguistically: Something newly introduced with no prior example.
 • Islamically (Shar‘an): Anything introduced into the religion without evidence.

Types of Innovation:
 1. Innovation in Customs:
Such as the invention of new technologies—this is permissible, because the default ruling in customs is permissibility.
 2. Innovation in Religion:
This is forbidden, because the default in religious matters is that they are restricted to textual evidence (tawqīfī).

Categories of Innovation in Religion:
 1. Innovations in Belief (Bid‘ah I‘tiqādiyyah):
Beliefs that contradict what Allah and His Messenger have conveyed.
Examples:

 • Anthropomorphism (tamthīl) or denial of divine attributes (ta‘ṭīl)
 • Denial of divine decree (qadar)

 2. Innovations in Practice/Actions (Bid‘ah ‘Amaliyyah):
Worshipping Allah in ways He has not legislated, such as:

 • Inventing acts of worship not prescribed in Islam
 • Adding to or taking away from prescribed acts of worship
 • Performing a valid act of worship in an innovated manner
 • Designating a specific time for an act of worship that the Sharī‘ah has not specified

Examples:
 • Building structures over graves
 • Celebrating religious holidays or events that have no basis in the religion

 3. Innovations of Abandonment (Bid‘ah Tarkiyyah):
Abandoning what is permissible or recommended as an act of worship.
Examples:

 • Abstaining from eating meat as a form of worship
 • Avoiding marriage as a form of devotion

Types of Innovations Based on Their Ruling:
 1. Major Innovations (Bid‘ah Mukaffirah):
Take a person out of Islam.
Examples:

 • The innovation of Rāfiḍah (extreme Shī‘a beliefs)
 • Claiming the Qur’an is created

 2. Minor Innovations (Bid‘ah Mufassiqah):
The person is sinful but does not leave Islam.
Examples:

 • Collective/group remembrance (dhikr)
 • Designating the night of mid-Sha‘bān for worship

Warnings Against Innovations and Refuting Them:

Sufficient are one verse and two ḥadīths:
 • The verse:

“This day I have perfected for you your religion, completed My favor upon you, and have approved for you Islam as your religion.”
[Surah al-Mā’idah: 3]

 • The ḥadīth:

“Whoever introduces into this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) something that is not from it, it will be rejected.”
[Agreed upon]
In another narration (Muslim): “Whoever does an act that is not in accordance with our command, it will be rejected.”

 • Another ḥadīth:

“The worst of matters are those newly invented [every innovation is misguidance], and every misguidance is in the Fire.”
[Narrated by Muslim; bracketed additions are from al-Nasā’ī]

Is There Such a Thing as a “Good Innovation”?

Anyone who divides innovation into:
 • Good innovation
 • Bad innovation

…is mistaken and in error. He contradicts the Prophet’s words:

“Every innovation is misguidance.”

The Prophet ruled that all innovations are misguidance, but this person claims some are good—which is a contradiction.

Causes Behind the Emergence of Innovations:
 • Ignorance of religious rulings
 • Following desires
 • Blind partisanship to opinions and personalities
 • Imitation of disbelievers
 • Relying on fabricated or weak ḥadīths
 • Cultural habits and superstitions not supported by the Sharī‘ah or sound intellect

Two Important Principles for Identifying and Refuting Innovations:
 1. In worship, the default ruling is prohibition and suspension—until there is proof of its validity.
 2. If an act of worship was needed or its cause was present during the Prophet’s time, and he did not perform it nor did his companions, this indicates it is not legislated.

Two Important Warnings:
 • Imam Mālik (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

“Whoever introduces an innovation in Islam, thinking it is good, has claimed that Muhammad betrayed the message, for Allah said: ‘This day I have perfected your religion.’ So what was not religion then, is not religion today.”

 • Shaykh al-Albānī (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

“We must know that even the smallest innovation introduced into the religion is forbidden.
There is no innovation—contrary to what some believe—that falls into the merely disliked category (makrūh).”

Some Widespread Innovations in the Muslim Ummah:
 • Celebrating the Prophet’s birthday and other religious birthdays
 • Celebrating the night of Isrā’ and Mi‘rāj
 • Celebrating mid-Sha‘bān
 • Celebrating birthdays
 • Seeking blessings from places, relics, or people—whether alive or dead
 • Collective/group remembrance (dhikr)
 • Requesting al-Fātiḥah be recited for the dead or at events
 • Performing ‘umrah specifically in the month of Rajab
 • Saying the intention (niyyah) out loud before prayer
 • Seeking intercession through a person’s status or honor
