Ruqyah (Incantation)

Definition:
 • Linguistically: The word ruqyah is the plural of ruqya, which means a charm or incantation used for healing or protection.
 • In Islamic Law (Shar‘an): It refers to verses from the Qur’an, prophetic supplications, or prayers recited over a sick person seeking healing.

Types of Ruqyah:
 1. Permissible Ruqyah (Ruqyah Mashru‘ah):
This is allowed in Islam, provided it meets three conditions (agreed upon by scholars):
 • It must be in clear Arabic language, with known and permissible meaning.
 • It must be made up of Qur’anic verses or Allah’s names and attributes.
 • One must not rely on it entirely—the belief should be that healing comes only by Allah’s will, and ruqyah is merely a means.
 2. Prohibited Ruqyah (Ruqyah Mamnu‘ah):
This is not allowed if it violates any of the above three conditions. Examples include:
 • Ruqyah in an unknown language or containing meaningless symbols.
 • Involving shirk (associating partners with Allah), such as invoking jinn or spirits.
 • Believing the ruqyah itself (not Allah) causes healing.

Evidence from the Sunnah on Ruqyah:
 • The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:
“Indeed, incantations (ruqyah), amulets (tama’im), and charms (tiwala) are shirk (associating partners with Allah).”
(Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood)
 • He (peace be upon him) also said:
“Present your ruqyah to me. There is no harm in ruqyah as long as it does not contain shirk.”
(Narrated by Muslim)
