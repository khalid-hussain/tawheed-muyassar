Intercession (الشفاعة)

Definition:
 • Linguistically: Derived from the verb shafaʿa (شفع), meaning to make something even or to pair it; shafʿ is the opposite of witr (odd).
 • Technically: It is mediating on behalf of another to bring benefit or remove harm.

Types of Intercession:

1. Intercession that is negated (الشفاعة المنفية):

A. Definition:
It is the intercession sought from other than Allah in matters that only Allah can control.

B. Its Evidence:
Allah says:

“O you who have believed, spend from that which We have provided for you before a Day comes in which there is no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And the disbelievers — they are the wrongdoers.”
[Surah Al-Baqarah: 254]


2. Intercession that is affirmed (الشفاعة المثبتة):

A. Definition:
It is the intercession requested from Allah alone.

Conditions:
 1. Allah’s permission for the intercessor to intercede.
 2. Allah’s approval of both the intercessor and the one interceded for.
 • Evidence:
Allah says:

“Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?”
[Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]

And He also says:

“And how many angels are in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except after Allah has given permission to whom He wills and is pleased with.”
[Surah An-Najm: 26]


Ruling on Asking for Intercession from Living People:

1. If you ask them for a permissible or lawful matter which they are capable of:
 • It is allowed, and is considered cooperation in righteousness.

2. If you ask them for something only Allah can do:
 • This is major shirk (associating partners with Allah).
