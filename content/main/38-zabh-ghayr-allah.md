Slaughtering for Other Than Allah

Definition of “Slaughtering” (al-Dhabḥ):
 • Linguistically: Originally means cutting or splitting.
 • Islamically: Taking a life and shedding blood as an act of reverence and nearness using a specific method.


Types of Slaughtering;: 

There are three categories:


1. Lawful Religious Slaughtering (Permissible Acts of Worship):

Examples:
 • Uḍḥiyah (Eid Al-Adha sacrifice)
 • Slaughtering a vowed offering for the sake of Allah
 • Sacrificial animals for Hajj (Hady)
 • Slaughtering an animal as expiation during Hajj or ‘Umrah
 • ‘Aqīqah (slaughtering for a newborn)
 • Slaughtering for charity to draw closer to Allah
 • Slaughtering to honour guests (by feeding them)

2. Permissible Slaughter (Non-Worship Related):

Examples:
 • A butcher slaughtering animals for selling.
 • Slaughtering for food (without intending worship or reverence).


3. Polytheistic (Shirk-Based) Slaughtering:

Examples:
 • Slaughtering for idols.
 • Slaughtering for jinn.
 • Slaughtering for domes, shrines, or graves.
 • Slaughtering before moving into a new home, intending to ward off jinn.
 • Slaughtering when the bride and groom enter the house, making them walk over the animal’s blood.
 • Slaughtering in the name of Allah, but mentioning another name besides Allah.


Summary:
 • Slaughtering is an act of worship and must be directed only to Allah.
Evidence:
“Say, indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, Lord of the worlds.”
— [Surah Al-An’am, 6:162]
 • Slaughtering for other than Allah is considered major shirk (polytheism), and the one who does so is cursed.
Evidence:
“Allah has cursed the one who slaughters for other than Allah.”
— [Narrated by Muslim]
