Fear
  Definition:
“It is an emotion that occurs when anticipating harm, destruction, or injury.”
 • Types of Fear:
 1. Major Shirk (Polytheism):
It is the fear of other than Allah in matters that only Allah can control.
Evidence: Allah says: “So do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are believers.” (Aali Imran: 175)
 2. Prohibited:
This occurs when a person leaves a duty or commits a sin out of fear of people.
Evidence: Allah says: “So do not fear people but fear Me.” (Al-Ma’idah: 44)
 3. Permissible:
This is natural fear, such as the fear of a lion, an enemy, or an unjust ruler.
Evidence: Allah says: “So he became in the city fearful, looking about.” (Al-Qasas: 18)
 4. Worship:
This is the fear of Allah alone.
Evidence: Allah says: “But for whoever feared the position of his Lord are gardens.” (Ar-Rahman: 46)


Types of Fear of Allah:

There are two types:
 1. Praiseworthy : It is the kind of fear that prevents you from disobeying Allah and motivates you to perform obligatory duties and refrain from what is prohibited.
 2. Blameworthy Fear:
This is the kind of fear that leads a person to despair and hopelessness about Allah’s mercy.
