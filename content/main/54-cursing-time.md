Cursing Time 

What is meant by it:
Cursing, blaming, and condemning ad-dahr (time), which refers to the passage of time or the era.

Rulings on reviling time:
It is divided into three categories:
 1. If the statement is purely informative, without blame:
Then this is permissible.
Example: 
“We’re exhausted from the intense heat today.”
Or as Prophet Lot (peace be upon him) said: “This is a difficult day.”
 2. If one reviles time believing it is the one that acts:
Such as believing that time itself turns events from good to bad — then this is major shirk (associating partners with Allah).
 3. If one reviles time because it is the setting for a disliked event, while believing that Allah is the one who caused it:
Then this is prohibited and one of the major sins.

Reviling time is an offense against Allah the Almighty:
The Prophet ﷺ said:
“Allah, the Exalted, said: The son of Adam hurts Me: he curses time, while I am time. I alternate the night and the day.”
[Agreed upon]
The meaning of “I am time” is “I manage and control time.

Note:
“Time” (ad-dahr) is not one of the Beautiful Names of Allah (al-Asmā’ al-Ḥusnā).
