Sorcery (As-Siḥr)

Definition:
 • Linguistically: Something whose cause is subtle and hidden.
 • Technically: Incantations, spells, charms, medicines, and substances that affect the heart and body by Allah’s permission.


Types of Sorcery:

1. Major Shirk (Polytheism):
This is done through jinn and devils. The sorcerer worships them, seeks nearness to them, and even prostrates to them in order to empower them against the victim.

2. Sinful and Aggressive Act:
This involves using drugs, herbs, chemicals, or illusions (like sleight of hand or eye deception). It does not involve actual worship of jinn.


Ruling on Sorcery:

A. If the sorcery falls under the first type (Major Shirk):
Then the sorcerer is a disbeliever (kāfir) and is executed as an apostate.

B. If the sorcery is of the second type (sinful act):
Then the sorcerer is not a disbeliever, but is considered a sinner and evildoer. He may be executed as a means of protecting society, if the ruler (imam) deems it necessary.

Evidence That Sorcery is Disbelief (Kufr):

Allah says:
“And they [the two angels] did not teach anyone until they had said, ‘We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].’”
— [Surah Al-Baqarah: 102]

Whoever practices, learns, or approves of sorcery has disbelieved and exited Islam.


Ruling on “An-Nushrah” (Removing Sorcery):

An-Nushrah: The act of removing sorcery from the afflicted person.

It is of two types:

1. Removing sorcery with another act of sorcery:
 • Forbidden
 • From the work of Shayṭān (Satan)

2. Removing sorcery using permissible means:
 • Such as Qur’anic ruqyah (spiritual healing), supplications, and lawful medications
 • Permissible and allowed


Reporting and Warning Against Sorcerers:
 • It is obligatory to report sorcerers and warn people about them.
 • This is part of forbidding evil and advising the Muslim community.


Signs to Identify a Sorcerer:

If even one of these signs is found in a so-called healer, he is a sorcerer without any doubt:
 • He asks the patient for their name and their mother’s name.
 • He requests an object that belonged to the patient (e.g., clothing, scarf, shirt, abaya).
 • Writing talismans or symbols (ṭilāsim).
 • Reciting incantations and unintelligible spells or charms.
 • Sometimes asks for a specific type of animal to be slaughtered without mentioning Allah’s name over it. He may smear the blood on the affected areas of the patient or throw it in a deserted place.
 • Gives the patient a talisman that contains squares filled with letters or numbers.
 • Murmurs or chants incomprehensible words.
 • Gives the patient papers to burn and use as incense.
 • Gives the patient items to bury in the ground.
