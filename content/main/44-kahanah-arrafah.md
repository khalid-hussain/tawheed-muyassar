Soothsaying and Fortune-Telling

Definition of a Kāhin (Soothsayer):
A person who claims to know future events through contact with jinn and devils.

Definition of a ‘Arraf (Fortune-Teller):
A person who claims knowledge of present matters, such as the location of a stolen item or a lost object, through hidden means.

Claiming Knowledge of the Unseen (Al-Ghayb):

This is disbelief (kufr) because it contradicts the Qur’an.
Evidence:
Allah says:
“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except Allah.”
(Surah An-Naml, 27:65)

Categories of Those Who Claim to Know the Unseen:
 • One who claims knowledge of the unseen through jinn is called a Kāhin (Soothsayer).
 • One who claims it by drawing lines in the sand is called a Rammāl (Diviner).
 • One who claims it through the stars is called a Munajjim (Astrologer).
 • One who claims knowledge of lost or stolen items through hidden methods is called a ‘Arraf (Fortune-Teller).

Ruling on Going to Soothsayers, Fortune-Tellers, and Sorcerers:

Two types:
 1. One who visits them and asks without believing them:
 • Ruling: It is haram (forbidden) and a major sin.
 • Consequence: Their prayer is not accepted for forty days.

Evidence:

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
“Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days.”
[Narrated by Muslim]
Explanation: This means he receives no reward for the prayer, though he is still required to perform it.

2. One who visits them, asks them, and believes what they say:
 • Ruling: This is disbelief (kufr) in what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him).
 • Evidence: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
“Whoever goes to a fortune-teller or soothsayer and believes what he says has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.”
[Narrated by the four Sunan compilers and Al-Hākim]
