Swearing by Other than Allah

Definition of Swearing (Ḥalaf):
 • Linguistically: It means commitment or binding oneself to something.
 • Islamically : It is affirming a statement by mentioning something venerated, using one of the letters of oath which are -waaw (و), baa’ (ب), and taa’ (ت) — as in Wallāhi, Billāhi, Tallāhi (By Allah).

Other Names for Swearing:
It is also referred to as:
 • Al-Yamīn (the oath)
 • Al-Qasam (the vow)

The Legitimate Oath (Permissible Swearing):

It must be:
 • By Allah (e.g., Wallāhi, Billāhi, Tallāhi)
 • Or by one of His Names (e.g., By Ar-Rahmān, Al-‘Azīm, As-Samī‘)
 • Or by one of His Attributes (e.g., By Allah’s Might, Mercy, Knowledge)

Ruling on Swearing by Other than Allah:

There are two rulings:
 1. If a person swears by something and glorifies it to the level of worship — such as glorifying it like or more than Allah — then this is Major Shirk (Shirk Akbar).
(This takes one out of the fold of Islam.)

2. If a person venerates something (when swearing by it) but does not reach the level of equating it with Allah’s veneration then this is Minor Shirk (Shirk Asghar).

Evidence for the Ruling on Swearing by Other than Allah:

The Prophet ﷺ said:
“Whoever swears by other than Allah has committed disbelief or shirk.”
[Reported by Ahmad, Abū Dāwūd, and At-Tirmidhī]

Examples of Swearing by Other than Allah:
 • Swearing by saints (awliyā’)
 • Swearing by the status of the Prophet ﷺ or status of saints
 • Swearing by someone’s life
 • Swearing by honour or trustworthiness


Summary of the Rulings on Swearing:

 • Swearing by anyone other than Allah is prohibited and considered shirk.
 • Swearing falsely by Allah is a major sin known as Yamīn Ghamūs (the immersing oath — because it plunges the one who swears into Hell).
 • Frequent swearing by Allah even if truthful, without need is prohibited due to its disrespectful nature.
 • Swearing truthfully by Allah when needed is permissible.


Expiation (Kaffārah) for Swearing by Other than Allah:

The one who swears by other than Allah should say: “Lā ilāha illa Allāh” (There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah).
The evidence for this is the statement of the Prophet ﷺ:

“Whoever swears and says in his oath: ‘By al-Lāt and al-‘Uzzā,’ then let him say: ‘Lā ilāha illa Allāh.’”
— [Agreed upon: Al-Bukhārī and Muslim]
