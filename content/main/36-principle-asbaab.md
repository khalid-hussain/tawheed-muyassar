Important Principles in the Matter of Causes (Asbāb)
 1. When a person uses means or causes, their reliance must be on Allah—not on the means themselves—because Allah is the one who creates and enables causes.
 2. One must understand that these causes are tied to Allah’s decree and will (Qadar).
 3. There are two ways to establish that something is a valid cause:
First: Through Islamic legislation (Sharʿ).
 • Example: Honey is a means of healing.
 • Proof: Allah’s saying: “In it [honey] is healing for people.” [Surah An-Nahl: 69]
Second: Through experience and natural law (Qadar).
 • Example: Fire is a cause of burning.
 • However, for something to be accepted through experience, its effect must be clearly evident after direct contact, because unclear effects might be based on claims or illusions—
 • For example: The claim that wearing a ring protects from the evil eye—this is a false or imagined cause.
