An Important Principle in the Unity of Worship (Tawheed al-‘Ibaadah):
 • Text of the Principle:
(Any action that is proven to be an act of worship — directing it to Allah is Tawheed (pure monotheism), and directing it to anyone else is Shirk (polytheism) and associating others with Allah.)

⸻

 • Evidence for this Principle:
There are many evidences, including:
 • Allah says:
“Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him.”
[Surah An-Nisa: 36]
 • Allah says:
“Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.”
[Surah Al-Isra: 23]
 • Allah says:
“Say, ‘Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from — that you not associate anything with Him.’”
[Surah Al-An’am: 151]
