# There is no God worthy of worship but Allāh

Evidence: Allāh says in the Quran:

<!-- TODO: ARABIC_AYAH -->

“Allāh bears witness that there is no god worthy of worship but Him, as do the
angels and those endowed with knowledge—upholding justice. There is no god
worthy of worship but Him, the Almighty, the Wise.” (Āl-ʿImrān Q3:18)

And He also says:

<!-- TODO: ARABIC_AYAH -->

“So know that there is no god worthy of worship but Allāh.” (Muhammad Q47:19)

Meaning: No one truly deserves to be worshipped except Allāh.

Incorrect Interpretations:

1. “There is no god but Allāh.” This is incorrect if understood to mean that
everything worshipped, whether rightfully or falsely, is Allāh. Meaning there
are other false gods that are worshipped, thus this interpretation does not
provide a comprehensive meaning of Laa ilaaha Illa Allāh.

2. “There is no Creator but Allāh.” While this is a true statement, it is only
part of the meaning. If this alone were the intended meaning, then there would
have been no dispute between the Prophet and his people, as they already
acknowledged Allāh as the sole Creator.

3. “There is no sovereignty but for Allāh.” While this is also part of the
meaning, it is not enough on its own. If Allāh were accepted as the only ruler
but others were still worshipped, true monotheism (Tawḥīd) would not be
achieved.

## Its Pillars

The statement “La ilaha illa Allāh” (There is no god worthy of worship but Allāh) has two pillars:

1. Negation (La ilaha – “There is no god worthy of worship”): This means rejecting worship of anything or anyone besides Allāh.

2. Affirmation (Illa Allāh – “except Allāh”): This means affirming that worship belongs to Allāh alone, with no partner.

Evidence: Allāh says in the Quran:

“Whoever disbelieves in Taghut (false gods)…” -- this is negation.”

…and believes in Allāh…” -- this is affirmation.

”…has grasped the firmest handhold.” (Al-Baqarah Q2:256)

And He also says:

“When Ibrahim (Abraham) said to his father and his people: ‘I disown what you worship’” -- this is negation.

“Except the One who created me, and He will guide me.” -- this is affirmation. (Az-Zukhruf Q43:26-27)

When Does Saying ‘La ilaha illa Allāh’ Benefit a Person?

- When they understand its meaning.

- When they act upon it—by abandoning worship of anything besides Allāh and worshipping Him alone.
