# Types of Major Shirk (Polytheism)

Major shirk is divided into four types:

1. Shirk of Invocation (دعوة). Evidence: The saying of Allah, the Exalted: “And
when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allah, making their faith pure for Him;
but when He delivers them to the land, behold, they associate others with Him.”
[Surah Al-‘Ankabut: 65]

2. Shirk of Intention, Will, and Purpose (النية والإرادة والقصد). Evidence: The
saying of Allah, the Exalted: “Whoever desires the life of this world and its
adornment – We fully repay them for their deeds therein, and they will not be
deprived. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter except the
Fire, and their deeds will be nullified, and they will be in vain.” [Surah Hud:
15–16]

3. Shirk of Obedience (الطاعة). Evidence: The saying of Allah, the Exalted:
“They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allah, and [also] the
Messiah, son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God;
there is no deity except Him. Exalted is He above what they associate with Him.”
[Surah At-Tawbah: 31]

   - Its clear interpretation (without doubt): It is obeying scholars and
     worshippers in disobedience (to Allah), not merely calling upon them, as
     the Prophet (peace be upon him) explained to ‘Adiyy ibn Hatim when he said:
     “We do not worship them.” The Prophet replied that their worship of them
     was through obedience to them in sin.

4. Shirk of Love (شرك المحبة). Evidence: The saying of Allah, the Exalted: “And
of the people are some who take others besides Allah as equals [to Him]; they
love them as they [should] love Allah.” [Surah Al-Baqarah Q2:165]
