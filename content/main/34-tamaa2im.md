Amulets (At-Tama’im):

Definition:
 • Linguistically: The plural of tamimah.
 • Islamically: Whatever is hung around the necks of children or others as protection from the evil eye.

Types of Amulets:
 1. Amulets containing Qur’anic verses or prophetic supplications:
The correct opinion is that they are prohibited, for three reasons:
 • (a) The general prohibition of amulets, with no specific exception (to this general rule)
 • (b) As a precaution, to block the means to prohibited amulets, since it can lead to using impermissible ones.
 • (c) Them being subject to disrespect and mistreatment, especially when the one wearing them enters the toilet to relieve themselves.
 2. Amulets not containing Qur’an or prophetic supplications:
These may contain names of jinn, devils, or incomprehensible symbols (incantations or talismans).
These are strictly forbidden and constitute shirk (associating partners with Allah) because they involve reliance on other than Allah.

Conclusion:
All amulets are prohibited — whether they contain verses of the Qur’an or not.
If they do not contain Qur’anic content, they are forbidden and a form of shirk.

Evidence:
The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:

“Indeed, incantations (ruqā), amulets (tamā’im), and charms (tiwalah) are shirk (polytheism).”
— [Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood]
