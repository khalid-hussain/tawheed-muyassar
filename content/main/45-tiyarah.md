At-Tiyarah (Superstition or Belief in Omens)

Definition:
 • Linguistically: Derived from the word tatayyur, meaning optimism or pessimism based on something.
 • In Islamic terminology: Pessimism caused by something seen, heard, or known (without valid evidence).

Ruling on Superstition (At-Tiyarah):
Superstition contradicts Tawheed (Islamic monotheism) in two ways:
 1. The superstitious person cuts off their trust in Allah and relies on something else.
 2. They become attached to something unreal, based on illusion or imagination.

Evidence for its prohibition:
 • Allah says:
“Indeed, their omen is with Allah, but most of them do not know.”
(Surah Al-A’raf: 131)
 • The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:
“There is no infection, no superstition, no owl (as a bad omen), and no Safar.”
(Agreed upon – Bukhari and Muslim)
 • He also said:
“Superstition is shirk (associating partners with Allah).”
(Narrated by Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhi)

The States of a Superstitious Person:
 1. They stop or avoid an action due to the bad omen:
 • This is one of the worst forms of superstition and pessimism.
 2. They proceed with the action but with anxiety, worry, and fear about the possible effects of the omen. This is less severe than the first.
 • However, both states represent a deficiency in Tawheed (belief in the oneness of Allah) and cause harm to the individual.

Cure for When Superstition Enters the Heart:

If someone feels superstition in their heart, they should say:
 1. 

“O Allah, no one brings good except You, and no one repels evil except You, and there is no power and no strength except through You.”
(Narrated by Abu Dawood)
 2. 

“O Allah, there is no omen except Yours, no good except Your good, and there is no god but You.”
(Narrated by Ahmad and authenticated by Al-Albani)

Then they should do the following:
 • Understand the harm of superstition.
 • Struggle against their own self (nafs) to resist such thoughts.
 • Believe in Allah’s decree and destiny (Qadaa and Qadar).
 • Think positively of Allah (husn adh-dhann).
 • Do Istikhara (the prayer for seeking guidance).

Definition of Forbidden Superstition:

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:

“Tiyarah (superstition) is only that which makes you proceed or hold back.”
(Narrated by Ahmad)

Good Omen (Al-Fa’l Al-Hasan):
 • Meaning:
A good word a person hears that brings them optimism and hope.
 • Example:
A person is about to travel and hears someone say “O Salim (safe/peaceful),” so he feels hopeful and reassured.
 • Ruling:
It is permissible and even liked.
 • Evidence:
The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
“And I like good omens (fa’l).”
(Agreed upon – Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

The Difference Between Superstition (Tiyarah) and Good Omen (Fa’l):
Superstition (Tiyarah):
 • Indicates bad thoughts about Allah.
 • Involves diverting trust or rights to others besides Allah.
 • Shows attachment of the heart to a creation that cannot benefit or harm.
Good Omen (Fa’l):
 • Reflects good thoughts about Allah.
 • It does not prevent a person from pursuing their goals or needs.
