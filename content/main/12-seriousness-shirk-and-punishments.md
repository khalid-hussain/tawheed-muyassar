# The Seriousness of Shirk and Its Punishments

1. Allah does not forgive shirk if a person dies without repenting from it:
Evidence:“Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives
what is less than that for whom He wills.” [An-Nisāʾ: 48]

2. The one who commits shirk is outside the fold of Islam; their blood and
wealth are not protected. Evidence: “And when the sacred months have passed,
then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege
them…” [At-Tawbah: 5]

3. Allah does not accept any deeds from a polytheist; all their previous good
deeds become worthless: Evidence: “And We will regard what they have done of
deeds and make them as dust dispersed.” [Al-Furqān: 23]

    Also: “And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you
    associate [others with Allah], your work would surely become worthless, and you
    would surely be among the losers.” [Az-Zumar: 65]

4. Paradise is forbidden for the one who commits shirk, and their eternal abode
is Hell: Evidence: “Indeed, he who associates others with Allah – Allah has
forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the
wrongdoers any helpers.” [Al-Māʾidah: 72]
