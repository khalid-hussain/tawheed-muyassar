Riyā’ (Showing off)

Definition:
 • Linguistically: To show something to others so they can see it.
 • In Islamic terms: To show acts of obedience to others so that they may see them and praise the doer.

Ruling on Riyā’:
 • Minor Riyā’: Considered minor shirk (shirk aṣghar).
 • If all or most of one’s deeds are done for show: Then it is major shirk (shirk akbar), and this does not come from a true believer—it is the trait of hypocrites.

The danger of Riyā’:
 1. It is minor shirk:
 • The Prophet ﷺ said:
“The thing I fear most for you is minor shirk.”
He was asked about it, and he said:
“Riyā’.”
[Narrated by Aḥmad]
 2. It is not forgiven if one does not repent from it:
 • Allah said:
“Indeed, Allah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills.”
[An-Nisā’: 48]
 • This includes both major and minor shirk.
 3. It nullifies the deed that is mixed with it:
 The Prophet ﷺ said:
“Allah, the Most High, said: ‘I am the One Who is most free of the need for having a partner. Whoever does a deed in which he associates someone else with Me, I leave him and his shirk (association).’”
[Reported by Muslim]

4. It is more dangerous than the trial of the Antichrist (Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl):
The Prophet ﷺ said:
“Shall I not tell you what I fear for you more than the Antichrist?”
They said, “Yes, O Messenger of Allah.”
He said:
“Hidden shirk: a man stands to pray and beautifies his prayer because he sees another man looking at him.”
[Reported by Aḥmad]
