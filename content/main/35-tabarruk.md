Al-Tabarrok (Seeking Blessing)

Meaning of Tabarruk:
 • Linguistically: It means abundance and permanence of something.
 • Islamically (Shar’an): It means seeking blessings, hoping for them, and believing in them.

Types of Tabarruk:

Two types:
 1. Permissible (Legitimate) Tabarruk.
 2. Prohibited Tabarruk.

 
First: Permissible Tabarruk:
 1. Seeking blessings through the Prophet’s person and what came from his body
 • This is exclusive to him and only during his lifetime.
 2. Seeking blessings through righteous sayings and actions
 • When the servant does them, he obtains goodness and blessings.
 • Examples: Reciting the Qur’an, remembering Allah (dhikr), and attending gatherings of knowledge.
 3. Seeking blessings from places that Allah has placed blessings in
 • Like mosques and certain blessed lands such as Makkah, Madinah, and Al-Sham (Greater Syria).
 • The purpose of seeking blessings from them: is through doing righteous acts and worshipping Allah in these places—not by rubbing against their walls or pillars.
