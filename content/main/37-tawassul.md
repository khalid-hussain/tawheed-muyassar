Tawassul (Seeking a Means to Allah)

Definition:
 • Linguistically: From wasīlah (means), which originally means something used to reach or draw closer to something.
 • In Islamic terminology: Taking a legitimate means to draw closer to Allah, the Exalted.

Types of Tawassul:

There are two main categories:

1. Permissible (Legitimate) Tawassul:

This includes three types:
 1. Tawassul by invoking one of Allah’s names or attributes
 • Example: “O Most Merciful, have mercy on me.”
 2. Tawassul through a righteous deed performed by the one making the supplication
 • Example: “O Allah, if I did that act sincerely for Your sake, then relieve my difficulty.”
 3. Tawassul by asking a living, righteous person to supplicate for you
 • Example: Asking a pious person to make du‘ā for you.


2. Impermissible (Forbidden) Tawassul:

This is any form of tawassul other than the three mentioned above, including:
 • Tawassul to Allah through someone’s status or honour, e.g. saying: “O Allah, by the rank of so-and-so…”
 • Supplicating to or making vows to saints and righteous people
 • Slaughtering animals in honour of saints or staying around their graves
