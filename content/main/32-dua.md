Du‘ā (Supplication)

1. Du‘ā is Worship:
Du‘ā is one of the most important forms of worship, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
“Du‘ā is worship.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi)

And Allah says:
“And the mosques are for Allah, so do not invoke anyone along with Allah.”
(Surah Al-Jinn: 18)

Types of Du‘ā (Supplication):

There are two types of du‘ā:

1. Du‘ā al-‘Ibādah (Supplication of Worship):
This refers to: Every act by which a person worships Allah.
Examples:
Prayer, pilgrimage (Hajj), charity, and fasting.

Why is it called du‘ā?
Because it includes a sense of asking — as if the person, by performing these actions, is asking Allah for mercy and entry into Paradise.

2. Du‘ā al-Mas’alah (Supplication of Request):
This refers to: Verbal asking and requesting from Allah.
Examples:
Saying: “O Allah, have mercy on me,” or “My Lord, forgive me.”

Calling upon Others besides Allah:

Since du‘ā is a form of worship, directing it to anyone other than Allah is considered shirk (polytheism) and disbelief.

The Evidence:
Allah says:
“And whoever invokes besides Allah another god for which he has no proof — then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.”
(Surah Al-Mu’minun: 117)
