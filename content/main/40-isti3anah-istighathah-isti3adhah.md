Ruling on Seeking Help, Relief, and Refuge from Other than Allah:

They are divided into two categories:

These acts are divided into two categories:

1. Permissible:

When four conditions are fulfilled:

A. Two conditions related to the requested matter (what help is being asked for):
 1. It must not be something exclusive to Allah (like creating, forgiving sins, etc.).
 2. The person being asked must be capable of doing the action.

B. Two conditions related to the person being asked for help, relief, or protection:
3. He must be alive.
4. He must be present.

2. Shirk (Polytheism):

If any of the above four conditions is not met, then the act becomes Shirk (associating partners with Allah).
