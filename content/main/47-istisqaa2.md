What is meant by it:
Istisqā’ means: seeking rain.
Anwā’: is the plural of naw’, and naw’ refers to the lunar mansions (star phases), which are twenty-eight in number.
What is meant by seeking rain through the Anwā’: attributing rainfall to the stars.

The categories of seeking rain through the stars:
Three categories:

1 – Major Shirk:
It has two forms:
A – That one calls upon the stars to grant rain.
Like saying: “O such-and-such star, give us rain,” or “O such-and-such star, relieve us,” and similar expressions.
B – That one attributes the occurrence of rain to these stars as being the doers by themselves without Allah, even if he does not call upon them.

2 – Minor Shirk:
That one considers these stars as causes.

3 – Permissible:
That one uses these stars only as signs and indicators, not as causes nor as independently effective agents.”

Evidence for the prohibition of seeking rain through the stars:

The saying of Allah, the Most High:
“And you make your provision that you deny (the truth).” [Al-Wāqiʿah: 82]

Commenting on this ayah Mujāhid said: “That is their saying regarding the stars: ‘We were given rain by such-and-such nawʾ and such-and-such nawʾ.’”

And the saying of the Prophet ﷺ:
“Do you know what your Lord has said?”
They said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.”
He said:
“This morning, some of My servants became believers in Me and some disbelievers. As for the one who said: ‘We were given rain by the grace and mercy of Allah,’ then he is a believer in Me and a disbeliever in the stars. And as for the one who said: ‘We were given rain by such-and-such nawʾ,’ then he is a disbeliever in Me and a believer in the stars.”
