Conclusion
At the end of this booklet, I turn to Allah with praise and thanks for the success and ease He has granted.
I hope this book has helped clarify the concept of Tawheed (monotheism), contributed to simplifying its rulings, and made its topics more accessible.
I also ask Allah, the Most High and Almighty, to reward with the best reward all those who contributed to the printing and distribution of this booklet, and to greatly increase their reward and blessings.
May Allahâ€™s peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.

Abdullah bin Ahmad Al-Huwail
