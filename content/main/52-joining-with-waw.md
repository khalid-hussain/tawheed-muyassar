Associating Others with Allah Using “و” (The Conjunction “And”)

What is Meant by This:
It refers to linking Allah and one of His creation using “و” (and) in matters where the creation has some role in the outcome.

Like saying:
 • “What Allah willed and you willed.” (ما شاء الله وشئت)
 • “I hope from Allah and from you.” (أرجو الله وأرجوك)
 • “I sought help from Allah and from you.” (استعنت بالله وبك)
 • “I have no one but Allah and you.” (ما لي إلا الله وأنت)
 • “If it weren’t for Allah and so-and-so, I would have perished.” (لولا الله وفلان هلكت)
 • And similar expressions.

Ruling:

a) If the person believes both (Allah and the creation) are equal in the matter:
This is Major Shirk (شرك أكبر) — even if he uses “ثم” (then) instead of “و” (and).

b) If the person does not believe they are equal:
This is considered Minor Shirk (شرك أصغر).

Correct Usage of These Phrases:

The correct way to phrase such expressions falls into two levels:


First Level: Using “ثم” (then) without believing in equality, 
       Example:
 • “What Allah willed, then you willed.” (ما شاء الله ثم شئت)
 • “I sought help from Allah, then from you.” (استعنت بالله ثم بك)

Second Level (Best & Preferred): Attributing the matter entirely to Allah
 Example:
 • “What Allah alone willed.” (ما شاء الله وحده)
 • “I sought help from Allah alone.” (استعنت بالله وحده)

This is the most correct and best way — free of any risk of shirk (association with Allah).


Difference Between Using “و” (and) vs “ثم” (then):
 • Using “و” (and):
Indicates equality and simultaneity — which is dangerous and could imply shirk depending on belief.
 • Using “ثم” (then):
Indicates sequence and subordination — it shows that the creation comes after and under Allah’s will.
