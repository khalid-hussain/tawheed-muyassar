Tawakkul (Trust in Allah)

Definition:
 • Linguistically: Delegation and reliance.
 • Islamically (Shar‘an): It is the heart’s reliance on Allah alone and entrusting matters to Him.

Shar‘i (Islamic) Tawakkul:

It involves three essential components:
 1. Sincere and genuine reliance on Allah.
 2. Complete trust in Allah and belief that all matters are in His control.
 3. Taking the permissible means and causes.

Categories of Tawakkul:
 1. Tawakkul as Worship (توكل عبادة):
This is placing trust in Allah alone, without any partner.
 2. Tawakkul that is Shirk (توكل شرك):
 • Relying on someone other than Allah in what is exclusive to Allah.
 • Relying entirely or partially on worldly means, disregarding Allah.
 3. Delegation (توكيل):
Appointing someone to act on your behalf in matters they are capable of handling — this is permissible.

The Difference Between Tawakkul and Tawkeel:
 • Tawakkul: An internal, heartfelt act (a matter of the heart).
 • Tawkeel: An external, outward action (appointing someone to act on your behalf).

“And put your trust in Allah if you are indeed believers.”
