# History of Shirk (Polytheism)


Tawheed (Monotheism) is the original foundation among the children of Adam,
while shirk (polytheism) came later and was not part of the original belief. Ibn
ʿAbbās (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Between Adam and Noah were ten
generations, all upon Tawheed.”

The first occurrence of shirk on Earth: It began among the people of Noah, when
they exaggerated the status of righteous men. They made images of them for
remembrance, which eventually led to worshipping them besides Allah. So Allah
sent Noah (peace be upon him) to call them back to pure monotheism.

Shirk among the people of Moses (Musa): It occurred when they took the calf as an idol for worship.

Shirk among the Christians (Nasara): It occurred after Jesus (Isa) was raised to
the heavens. A man named Paul, who pretended to believe in Christ but intended
to corrupt the religion, introduced the belief in the Trinity, the worship of
the cross, and many pagan elements.

Shirk among the Arabs: It was introduced by ‘Amr ibn Luhayy Al-Khuzaa’i, who
altered the religion of Abraham (Ibrahim, peace be upon him) and brought idols
to the land of Hijaz, commanding the people to worship them.

Shirk in the Ummah of Muhammad (peace be upon him): Appeared after the fourth
Hijri century through the Fāṭimid Shia, who built shrines over graves,
introduced the innovation of celebrating birthdays of the Prophet (Mawālid), and
exaggerated the status of the righteous.

It also spread with the rise of deviant Sufism, marked by excessive
glorification of spiritual leaders (mashāyikh) and followers of mystical paths
(ṭuruq), (leading some to seek blessings and help from them instead of Allāh.)
