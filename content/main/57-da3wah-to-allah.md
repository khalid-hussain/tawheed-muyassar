Calling to Tawheed (Monotheism)

Calling others to Allah is a matter of great importance and immense virtue. It is the mission of the prophets and messengers, and the field of the righteous and the pious.

Allah the Almighty says:

“Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good preaching, and argue with them in a way that is best.”
(Surah An-Nahl, 16:125)

And He also says:

“Say, this is my way: I call to Allah with insight—I and those who follow me.”
(Surah Yusuf, 12:108)

The Prophet ﷺ said:

“By Allah, if Allah guides a single person through you, it is better for you than red camels (the most valuable wealth of the time).”
[Agreed upon]

He ﷺ also said:

“Whoever calls to guidance will have a reward equal to that of those who follow it, without any decrease in their reward.”
[Narrated by Muslim]

Tawheed is the First Thing to Call To

The first and most important thing that must be taught, understood, practiced, and preached is Tawheed (the Oneness of Allah).

The proof:
When the Prophet ﷺ sent Mu’adh to Yemen, he said:

“Let the first thing you call them to be the testimony that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah.”
In another narration:
“…that they should worship Allah alone.”
[Agreed upon]

Practical Ways to Call to Tawheed

Here are a few easy and effective methods that are suitable for everyone and not difficult to carry out:
 • Printing and distributing books and pamphlets that teach Tawheed.
 • Reaching out to businesspeople to support the printing and distribution of books on Tawheed and Islamic beliefs.
 • Copying and distributing audio recordings that explain and promote Tawheed (monotheism).
 • Delivering talks, sermons, and lectures on Tawheed for those who are able—or arranging such sessions with scholars and preachers.
 • Teaching children and family members at home the basics of Tawheed, using books on Islamic creed—and offering them rewards and incentives for learning.
