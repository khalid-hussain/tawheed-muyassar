Types of Love (Aqsaam al-Mahabbah):

Love is divided into four categories:

⸻

 1. Worship:
 • This is the love of Allah.
 • And the love of what Allah loves.
 • Evidence: Allah says:
“But those who believe are stronger in love for Allah.”
[Surah Al-Baqarah: 165]

⸻

 2. Polytheism (Shirk):
 • It is the love of something other than Allah, accompanied by humiliation and veneration in a manner that is only due to Allah.
 • Evidence: Allah says:
“And [yet] among the people are those who take other than Allah as equals [to Him]. They love them as they should love Allah.”
[Surah Al-Baqarah: 165]

⸻

 3. Sin (Ma‘siyah):
 • This is the love of sins, innovations (in religion), and prohibited matters.
 • Evidence: Allah says:
“Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah knows, and you do not know.”
[Surah An-Nur: 19]

⸻

 4. Natural Love:
 • Such as the love of children, family, oneself, and the like.
 • This type of love is permissible.

And the evidence is His saying, the Exalted:
“Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire — of women and sons, heaped-up sums of gold and silver, fine branded horses, and cattle and tilled land. That is the enjoyment of worldly life, but Allah has with Him the best return.”
[Surah Aal ‘Imran: 14]
