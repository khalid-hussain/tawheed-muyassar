Pillars of Faith (ʾArkān al-ʾĪmān)
 • They are six:

 1. To believe in Allah,
 2. His angels,
 3. His books,
 4. His messengers,
 5. The Last Day,
 6. Divine decree (Qadar), both its good and its evil.

⸻

Here is what each pillar includes:

1. Belief in Allah:

It includes four aspects:
 • Belief in His existence,
 • Belief in His Lordship (that He alone is the Creator, Sustainer, and Owner of all things),
 • Belief in His Divinity (that He alone deserves to be worshipped),
 • Belief in His Names and Attributes.

⸻

2. Belief in the Angels:

It includes four aspects:
 • Belief in their existence
 • Belief in those whose names we know, like Jibreel (Gabriel), and belief in them generally for those whose names we do not know,
 • Belief in what we know of their characteristics,
 • Belief in what we know of the tasks they perform by the command of Allah.

⸻

3. Belief in the Books:

It includes four aspects:
 • Belief that their revelation is truly from Allah,
 • Belief in those books whose names we know, like the Qur’an, the Torah, and the Gospel (Injeel),
 • Believing the authentic reports they contain, such as the reports in the Qur’an and in previous scriptures that have not been altered or distorted and have been correctly transmitted in our Shari’ah,
 • Acting upon the rulings of what has not been abrogated, accepting and submitting to it whether or not we understand its wisdom. All previous scriptures have been abrogated by the Qur’an.

⸻

4. Belief in the Messengers:

It includes four aspects:
 • Belief that their messages are true and from Allah; and whoever disbelieves in the message of one of them has disbelieved in all of them,
 • Belief in those messengers whose names we know, like Muhammad, Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), ‘Isa (Jesus), and Nuh (Noah), peace be upon them all,
 • Believing in what has been authentically reported about them (the Messengers),
 • Acting according to the Shari’ah (law) of the Messenger who was sent to us — Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final Messenger sent to all of humanity.

⸻

5. Belief in the Last Day:

It includes three aspects:
 • Belief in the resurrection (after death),
 • Belief in the reckoning (accountability) and the reward or punishment,
 • Belief in Paradise and Hell.

Included within belief in the Last Day is belief in everything that happens after death, such as the trial of the grave, its punishment, and its bliss.

⸻

6. Belief in Divine Decree (Qadar):

It includes four aspects:
 • Belief that Allah has knowledge of everything, in detail and in entirety,
 • Belief that Allah wrote everything in the Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz),
 • Belief that everything that happens is by Allah’s will,
 • Belief that all created things are created by Allah — their essence, their attributes, and their movements.

Proofs for the Six Pillars of Faith (Iman):
 1. From the Qur’an:
Allah the Exalted said:

“It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards the east or the west, but righteousness is in one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, and the Prophets…”
[Surah Al-Baqarah 2:177]

 2. Allah the Exalted also said:

“Indeed, We have created everything according to a decree (qadar).”
[Surah Al-Qamar 54:49]

From the Sunnah:
What is reported in the Hadith of Jibreel (Gabriel), when he asked the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):

“Tell me about Iman (faith).” The Prophet said: “It is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in Qadar (divine decree), both its good and its evil.”
