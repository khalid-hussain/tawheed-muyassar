The Pillars of Islam
 There are five:
 • Testifying that there is no god worthy of worship but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.
 • Establishing the prayer.
 • Giving Zakah (obligatory charity).
 • Fasting during the month of Ramadan.
 • Performing Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House (Ka‘bah) for those who are able to do so.

The Pillars Are Divided into Two Categories:
 1. Pillars Without Which the Structure Cannot Stand (called the Foundational Pillars):
These are two:
 • The Two Testimonies of Faith (Shahadatayn).
 • Establishing the prayer.
 2. Pillars Without Which the Structure Is Incomplete (called the Completion Pillars):
These are three:
 • Giving Zakah.
 • Fasting during Ramadan.
 • Performing Hajj.
