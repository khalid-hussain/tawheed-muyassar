**IMPORTANCE AND VIRTUES OF TAWHEED**

1.  ***It\'s the greatest pillar of Islam:***

And its biggest support. It is not possible for a person to enter into
Islam unless he testifies/establishes tawheed and acknowledges his
servitude towards Allah and denies it for anyone except Him.

The prophet said: Islam is built upon five things:

-   Testifying that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah,
    and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah

-   Establishing the prayer

-   Giving zakat

-   Fasting Ramadhan

-   Performing Hajj

2.  ***It\'s the most important of the essential matters and the first
    of obligations:***

It precedes all the deeds and is the first of all the important actions
due to its high status and great importance.

It is the first thing which is called towards (when inviting or teaching
someone Islam). The prophet said to Muaadh when he sent him to Yemen"
you are going towards a group of people from Ahlul Kitab (people of the
book), so let the first thing which you call them towards be testifying
that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah" in another
narration " that they single Allah out in worship". (agreed upon)

3.  ***Acts of worship are not accepted without it:***

Tawheed is from the conditions of its validity, and the foundation of
its acceptance. Worship is not termed as worship except with tawheed,
just like a prayer (salah) would not be named as a prayer(salah) unless
being in a state of purity. So when shirk enters the worship it corrupts
it, just like something pure is corrupted by impurity. Worship without
tawheed turns into shirk ruining the deed and nullifying it and causes
the concerned person to abide in Hellfire forever.

4.  ***Means of safety and guidance in this world and the next:***

Evidence for it is the saying of Allah: "Those who believe and did not
tarnish their faith with wrong-doing for them there is security, and it
is they who have been guided to the right way." Surah Anaam verse 82

And the term "zulm"(wrong-doing) here refers to shirk as explained by
the prophet.

Bukhari (484/2) Have to find hadith

Ibn Katheer may Allah have mercy on him said about this verse:

"These are people who have singled out their worship to be only for
Allah without associating anything with Him. Those are the ones who will
be secure on the day of judgement and guided in this world and the next.
So whosoever comes with tawheed completely, for him is complete guidance
and security and shall be admitted into paradise without punishment."

Shirk is the highest injustice and tawheed is the epitope of justice.

5.  ***Tawheed is the reason for entering paradise and safety from
    hellfire:***

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, \"He who bears witness that there is no
true god except Allah, alone having no partner with Him, that Muhammad
is His slave and His Messenger, that \'Isa (Jesus) is His slave and
Messenger and he (Jesus) is His Word which He communicated to Maryam
(Mary) and His spirit which He sent to her, that Jannah is true and Hell
is true; Allah will make him enter Jannah accepting whatever deeds he
accomplished\".

\[Al-Bukhari and Muslim\].

The prophet also said: Allah will make hellfire forbidden for one who
says laa ilaaha illa Allah,

Intending by it Allahs pleasure. (Bukhari and muslim)

6.  ***Tawheed is thee means of rescue from distress of this world and
    hereafter:***

Ibn alQayyim said:

Tawheed is a refuge for its foes as well as its allies.

a.  As for its foes, then it rescues them from the difficulties and
    calamities of this life: Allah says: "And when they mount upon the
    ships they pray to Allah, making their faith pure for Him only, but
    when He bringeth them safe to land, behold! they ascribe partners
    (unto Him)" Ankabut 65

b.  As for its allies then it rescues them from the difficulties and
    calamities of this life and the next. This is the Sunnah(way) of
    Allah with His slaves. And know that nothing removes difficulties of
    this life like Tawheed does. This is why the supplication of the
    distressed is with tawheed and the supplication of Yunus by which no
    anguished person supplicates with except that Allah will lift his
    difficulties by Tawheed.

> Also nothing puts one into great difficulties except Shirk, and
> nothing saves one from it but Tawheed. It is a suitable refuge, a
> retreat, a protection and a relief from these difficulties.

7.  ***Tawheed is the wisdom behind the creation of humans and Jins:***

Allah says: " And I have not created the Jinnkind and Humankind except
for my worship" surah dhaariyat -- 59. Meaning I created them, so they
single Me out in worship. So, the messengers were not sent, the books
were not revealed, nor were the laws set and nor was the creation
brought into existence except for a single purpose which is that Allah
is worshiped alone.

**LAA ILAAHA ILLA ALLAH**

Evidence: "Allah ˹Himself˺ is a Witness that there is no god ˹worthy of
worship˺ except Him---and so are the angels and people of knowledge. He
is the Maintainer of justice. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except
Him---the Almighty, All-Wise". Al Imran verse 18

"And know that there is no true deity worthy of worship except Allah".
Surah Muhammad verse 19

Its meaning: There is absolutely no one worthy of worship except Allah
alone.

Other meanings which are incorrect:

1.  There is no deity except Allah: This is not correct because this can
    mean every deity whether true or false is Allah.( Meaning there are
    other deities who claim to be God but are false)

2.  There is no creator but Allah: Although some portion of it is true
    but it is not entirely correct and is not what is intended. If this
    was the meaning of Laa Ilaaha Illa Allah, then there would have been
    no argument between the prophet and his people as they clearly
    agreed to this fact.

3.  There is no authority/Governor except Allah: Similar to above even
    though this is true, but it does not provide the actual intended
    meaning. That is because even if Allah is singled out for His
    leadership but someone else is worshipped alongside, then tawheed is
    not properly established.

It has two pillars :

1\. Negation (no deity worthy of worship)

Meaning : To deny worship for anyone who is worshiped besides Allah.

2\. Confirmation/affirmation (except Allah )

Meaning: To affirm worship for Allah alone without associating partners
with Him.

Evidence: Allah says: "So whoever rejects false gods(Taagoot)" this is
denial, "and believes in God " this is affirmation, "has grasped the
firmest hand-hold". Al-Baqara: 256

And His saying: "And when Ibrahim said to his father and people, I
renounce what you worship" showing denial, "Except Him Who did create
me" showing affirmation, "and verily, He will guide me". Zukhruf:26-27

When will saying Laa ilaha illa Allah benefit a person?

1- When one knows/recognizes it\'s meaning

2- And acts according to its requirements/conditions ( which is leaving
worship for anyone other than Allah, and worshiping Allah alone).

**\
**

**CONDITIONS OF LAA ILAAHA ILLA ALLAH**

1\. Knowledge, which opposes Ignorance.

Meaning: Knowing the meaning of Laa Illaha Illa Allah (the denial and
affirmation).

Evidence: Saying of Allah: "And know that there is no true deity worthy
of worship except Allah". Surah Muhammad verse 19

2\. Certainty, which opposes Doubt.

Meaning: That the one who says (the shahaadah) is upon complete
certainty that Allah is the only true deity worthy of worship.

Evidence: The (true) believers are only those who believe in Allah and
His Messenger, then they did not fall into suspicion. And those who
struggle hard in the Way of Allah with their wealth and lives, they
indeed, they are the loyal ones. Hujurat- 15

3\. Sincerity, which opposes Shirk (associating partners with Allah).

Meaning: That you single out all the worship for Allah alone, not
directing anything (from the worship) for anyone other than Allah.

Evidence: And they were not commanded except to worship Allah ,
\[being\] sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth. Bayyinah verse
5

4\. Truthfulness, which opposes Falsehood.

Meaning: That you utter the Shahadah while being truthful to it, so that
your tongue follows your heart ( meaning that what is inside the heart
is the same as what is apparent on the lips)

Evidence: Saying of Allah: "Alif-laam-Meen, Do the people suppose that
they will be let off because they say, 'We have faith,' and they will
not be tested, We certainly tested those before them. And ˹in this way˺
Allah will clearly distinguish between those who are truthful and those
who are liars." Ankabut:1-3

5\. Love, which opposes Hatred.

Meaning: That you utter this statement while having the love of Allah
and His messenger, and that you love this statement and whatever it
entails.

Evidence: Saying of Allah-"Still there are some who take others as
Allah's equal---they love them as they should love Allah---but the
˹true˺ believers love Allah even more." Baqarah: 165

6\. Submission, which opposes Forsaking.

Meaning: That you worship Allah alone and submit to His
legislation(Islamic Law), and have faith in it, and believe that it is
the truth.

Evidence: "Turn to your Lord ˹in repentance˺, and ˹fully˺ submit to Him"
Zumar 54

7\. Acceptance, which opposes Rejection/Refusal.

Meaning: That you accept these words (laa ilaaha illa Allah) and accepts
whatever they imply and attest to by being sincere to Allah in worship
and leaving the worship of anything else besides Him.

Evidence: "Indeed they, when it was said to them, "There is no deity
worthy of worship but Allah," were arrogant, And were saying, "Are we to
leave our gods for a mad poet?" Saffat 35-36

8\. Disbelief in whatever is worshipped besides Allah.

Meaning: That you disassociate yourself from worshipping other than
Allah and believe that it is falsehood.

Evidence: "So whoever rejects false gods(Taagoot)" this is denial, "and
believes in God " this is affirmation, "has grasped the firmest
hand-hold". Al-Baqara: 256

**TESTIMONY \"MUHAMMAD (**[ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}**) IS THE MESSENGER OF
ALLAH\"**

Evidence : Saying of Allah "There certainly has come to you a messenger
from among yourselves. He is concerned by your suffering, anxious for
your well-being, and gracious and merciful to the believers" Taubah-128

It\'s meaning:

Absolute attestation that emminates from a sincere heart and that which
confirms to the statement of the tongue, that is: Muhammad
([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) is the servant of Allah and His messenger sent to both
Humans and Jinns.

Its pillars:

1\. Acknowledgment of him being a messenger ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}).

Evidence: "Muhammad is the messenger of Allah" alfath:29

2\. Belief in his servitude to Allah (that he was a slave of Allah)
([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}).

Evidence: "And that when the Servant of Allah stood up supplicating Him,
they almost became about him a compacted mass.\" Jinn -- 19

Thus, he is a messenger not to be denied and a slave not to be
worshiped.

Its conditions:

1\. Affirming his truthfulness in whatever he informed ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}).

2\. Obeying him in what he commanded ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}).

3\. Staying away from whatever he ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) prohibited.

4\. And that Allah be not worshiped except as he ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"})
directed/ordained.

**SHIRK (ASCRIBING PARTNERS TO ALLAH)**

Definition of shirk:

LINGUISTIC: Setting partners and comparison.

ISLAMIC LAW: Treating/making someone other than Allah equal with Allah
in things which are only specific to Him.

Its types:

1\. MAJOR SHIRK: Every deed termed as Shirk by Allah, and it implies
putting that person outside the fold of Islam.

2\. MINOR SHIRK: Every deed whether from sayings or actions which is
termed as Shirk or Kufr, but it is known from the evidence of the
religion that such a deed doesn\'t put a person outside the fold of
Islam.

The difference between major and minor shirk:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| MAJOR SHIRK                       | MINOR SHIRK                       |
+===================================+===================================+
| Puts the person outside the fold  | Doesn\'t put a person outside     |
| of Islam.                         | Islam.                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Causes the person to remain in    | Doesn\'t cause the person to be   |
| Hellfire for eternity.            | in Hellfire for eternity.         |

| Makes all the deeds worthless.    | Doesn\'t make all the deeds       |
|                                   | worthless except those which are  |
|                                   | mixed with Riya\' (showing off).  |

| (This is in context with the      |                                   |
| concept of Jihaad when such a     |                                   |
| situation arises)                 |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

**\
**

**TYPES OF MAJOR SHIRK**

Major shirk is of four types:

1\. Shirk of supplication

Evidence is the saying of Allah: "If they happen to be aboard a ship
˹caught in a storm˺, they cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion.
But as soon as He delivers them ˹safely˺ to shore, they associate
˹others with Him once again˺.(29:65)

2\. Shirk of intention and will

Evidence is the saying of Allah: "Whoever desires ˹only˺ this worldly
life and its luxuries, We will pay them in full for their deeds in this
life---nothing will be left out. It is they who will have nothing in the
Hereafter except the Fire. Their efforts in this life will be fruitless
and their deeds will be useless."

(11:15,16)

3\. Shirk of obedience

Evidence: "They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides
Allah, and \[also\] the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were not
commanded except to worship one God; there is no deity except Him.
Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him." (9:31)

In the tafseer of the above ayah it is mentioned: It is the obedience of
the scholars and the monks in evil that constitutes shirk, not
supplication to them. Just as the prophet also cleared this concept to
Adi Bin Haatim when he told the prophet: "we did not worship them" then
the prophet told him that their obedience to them was their worship to
them.

4\. Shirk of love

Evidence: "Still there are some who take others as Allah's equal---they
love them as they should love Allah---but the ˹true˺ believers love
Allah even more." (2:165)

**\
**

**EXAMPLES OF MAJOR AND MINOR SHIRK**

Examples for Major shirk:

*Apparent major shirk:*

1.Sacrifize/slaughtering for other than Allah.

2\. Making a vow for other than Allah.

3\. Asking for help (in things in which only Allah can help) from other
than Allah.

*Hidden major shirk:*

1.Shirk of munafiqeen (hypocrites) and their show-off (showing Islam
outwardly and hiding their shirk)

2.Fearing something secret/hidden. It\'s a fear of something other than
Allah in matters over which only ALLAH is capable.

*Apparent minor shirk:*

1\. Swearing by other than Allah

2\. Saying: \"what Allah wishes AND what you wish

3\. Saying: \"if it was not because of Allah AND you\"

*Hidden minor shirk:*

1\. Showing off (in small amounts)

2\. Evil omens

A beneficial dua for protection against shirk:

Abu Musa Alashari narrates: The prophet addressed us once and said: "O
people, be cautious of this shirk for verily it is more concealed than
the movement of an ant". So someone said " How shall we protect
ourselves when it is more concealed than the movement of an ant?" The
prophet replied "say: O Allah I seek refuge in You lest I associate
anything with you while I know it, and I seek your forgiveness for what
I do not know." Narrated by Imam Ahmed and declared Hassan by sheikh
Albani.

**HISTORY OF SHIRK**

Tawheed was the basis of children of Adam and Shirk was extrinsic (came
from another source).

As is reported to by Ibn Abas: Between Adam and Noah there were 10
Quroon (term used in arabic of a time period), All of them were upon
Tawheed.

First Shirk that appeared on earth was among the people of Nooh
([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) when they transgressed in the righteous people. First,
they made their pictures/statues (in reverence and respect to them) then
eventually it lead them to worship these statues. Hence, Allah sent
prophet Nooh to call them towards tawheed.

Shirk appeared among the people of Musa ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) when they took
the Calf as an object of worship.

Shirk among the Christians appeared after Jesus was raised to the
heavens alive. After which Pauls came who claimed faith in Jesus while
actually deceiving people. He bought trinity into their religion along
with worshipping the cross and many other pagan rituals.

Shirk among Arabs appeared at the hands of Amr Bin Luhai Al-khuza\'i who
changed the religion of Ibrahim and brought/imported idols to the land
of Hijaz and commanded to worship them.

Shirk in the Ummah of Muhammad ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) appeared at the hands of
Fatimi Shias when they established tomb of saints on the graves and
brought forth the innovation of birthdays in Islam and went into
extremes in pious people.

And likewise also innovated on the appearance of corrupted tasawwuf by
exaggerating in scholars and people of turuq.

**SERIOUSNESS OF SHIRK AND ITS PUNISHMENTS**

1\. Verily Allah doesn\'t forgive a person who dies (committing major
shirk) and didn\'t repent from it

Evidence: "Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him
˹in worship˺, but forgives anything else of whoever He wills." AlNisa-
48

2\. One who commits major shirk leaves the fold of Islam and his blood
and property becomes lawful.

Evidence: "But once the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists
˹who violated their treaties˺ wherever you find them, 1 capture them,
besiege them" taubah verse 5

3\. Verily Allah doesn\'t accept any deed from a polytheist. Whatever
deeds that person has done in the past will reduced to dust particles
scattered about.

Evidence : Evidence: "And We will turn to deal with all the (supposedly
good) deeds that they did (in the world), and will reduce them all to
dust particles scattered about." Furqan 23.

"It has already been revealed to you---and to those ˹prophets˺ before
you---that if you associate others ˹with Allah˺, your deeds will
certainly be void and you will truly be one of the losers." Zumar-65

4\. Verily the entrance to paradise is prohibited for him and he will
serve an eternity in hellfire.

Evidence: "Whoever associates others with Allah ˹in worship˺ will surely
be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the Fire. And the
wrongdoers will have no helpers." Maaidah 72

**NULLIFIERS OF ISLAM**

What is intended by it: Actions which spoil and make ones Faith (Islam)
null and void. These are many however, the most dangerous and those
which most of the people fall into are the following:

1\. Shirk in the worship of ALLAH:

From the examples is: Slaughtering (animals) for other than Allah, like
someone who slaughters for a Jinn or a dead person.

Evidence: "Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him
˹in worship˺, but forgives anything else of whoever He wills." AlNisa-
48

2\. Whoever makes between him and Allah intermediaries, supplicating to
them and asking them for intersession and putting ones trust/depending
on them, then that person has disbelieved by consensus (of scholars).

3\. One who doesn\'t consider the polythiests to be disbelievers or
doubts their disbelief or considers their way(religion) to be correct,
then such person has disbelieved.

4\. Whoever believes that the guidance or ruling of someone other than
the prophet is more complete and better than his guidance and ruling,
like people who give precedence to the rulings of Taghoot (false gods)
over his ruling. Such people have disbelieved.

5\. Whoever hates/detests anything from what the prophet ﷺ came with
even if it is acted upon has disbelieved.

6\. Whoever mocks at a thing from the religion, or its rewards or
punishments has disbelieved.

Evidence: "Say: \"Was it at Allah, and His Ayat and His Messenger that
you were mocking, \`Make no (false) excuses (now), you have certainly
disbelieved after your confession of belief." Tawbah 65- 66

7\. Sorcery /witchcraft

From them is using/giving drugs and potions (liquids to consume) which
are used to cause affection and hate between people. So, anyone who does
such acts or is pleased with it has disbelieved.

Evidence: " The two angels never taught anyone without saying, "We are
only a test ˹for you˺, so do not disbelief". Surah Baqarah 102

8\. Supporting the polythiests and helping them against Muslims

Evidence: "O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as
guardians---they are guardians of each other. Whoever does so will be
counted as one of them. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing
people." Surah maidah 51

9\. Believing that some people are excused from following the law of
Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

Evidence: "And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam (Submission to
Allah), it shall not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he shall
be of the losers." Surah alImran 85

10\. Turning away from the religion of Allah not learning it and not
implementing and acting upon it.

Evidence: "And who does more wrong than the one who is reminded of
Allah's revelations then turns away from them? We will surely inflict
punishment upon the wicked." Surah Sajdah 22

Important points:

1\. When it comes to the application of these nullifiers, there is no
difference between a person who is joking or serious or fearful except
someone who is forced to do one of the above actions.

2\. These nullifiers are amongst the most dangerous and most fallen into
by people. Thus it is obligatory upon every muslim to be aware of these
and be fearful of falling into one.

**DISBELIEF IN TAAGHOOT**

Lord, I surely shall find better than this when I return to Him, His
companion said to him while disputing with him: Do you disbelieve in Him
Who created you from dust, then from a small seed, then He made you a
perfect man? Muhammad Sarwar: His friend said to him, \"How can you
disbelieve in the One who turned clay into sperm out of which He created
you?, But as far as I am concerned, God alone is my Lord and I set up no

they stand lazily, showing \[themselves to\] the people and not

AMULETS FROM THE QUR\'AN AND PROPHETIC SUPPLICATIONS:

The scholars differed on this. The soundest opinion is that they are
prohibited for the following reasons-

1\. Generality of the prohibition of amulets and not finding anything
which specifies the general.

2\. Blocking the means (leading to Shirk).

3\. It (Quran) being susceptible to debasement as people may enter
toilets etc while wearing these.

AMULETS FROM OTHER THAN THE QUR\'AN AND PROPHETIC SUPPLICATIONS:

Like ones which contain names of Jinns and devils (shayateen) or
meaningless talismans (seals inscribed with mysterious words), these are
clearly impermissible and are from Shirk because they involve attachment
to other than Allah.

Summary:

Using all the amulets are prohibited whether using quran or something
other than that, and if it contains something other than the quran an
prophetic supplications then it is tantamount to shirk.

should be on ALLAH and not on the means itself because it is Allah who
is the causer and originator of the means.

in colors, in which there is healing for people.\" Nahl- 69

2\. By experience: Like fire is a cause for Burning. However it should

2\. Intending to seek blessings from the graves.

3\. Giving rewards at the graves

3\. Intending a journey/travel for the sake of visiting graves.

3\. VISIT WHICH IS SHIRK

Opposing tawheed. Examples:

To direct any form of worship to the person in the grave like:

1\. Supplicating to the person in the grave.

2\. Seeking help and relief from him.

3\. Sacrifice and vowing for him.

**SOCERRY (SIHR)**

Definition:

LINGUISTIC: Something whose reason is hidden.

ISLAMIC LAW: Incantations, enchantments, amulets, supplications, and
drugs which affect the heart and the body by the permission of Allah.

It\'s types :

1\. MAJOR SHIRK: It\'s the one done by the means of Jins and Satans, by
worshipping them, seeking nearness to them, prostrating to them, so that
they influence (cause harm) to the victim.

2\. DISOBEDIENCE AND OPPRESSION: The ones which are done by the means of
drugs and medicaments etc. From this also comes slight of hand and
deceiving the eyes.

RULING ON SIHR

If it\'s from the first type, then he is a disbeliever, and should be
killed (as apostacy).

EVIDENCE: \"But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We
are a trial, so do not disbelieve \[by practicing
magic\].\"(Al-Baqarah:102)

If it\'s from second type, then he is counted as a wicked (evil) person.
And may be killed if the Imam (wali al amr) decides so, to prevent
sorcery attacks.

Ruling of nushrah:

DEFINITION: Lifting off effects off sorcery from the affected person.

TWO TYPES:

1\. FORBIDDEN: Curing sorcery by using sorcery like it. It if from the
deeds of satan.

2\. PERMISSIBLE: Curing sorcery by using legislated Ruqya and
permissible supplications:

SPREADING AND SHARING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SORCERY AND WARNING AGAINST THE
SORCERER:

It\'s obligatory to spread and share knowledge about sorcery warn people
against the sorcerers, because it falls under forbidding evil and
advising Muslims.

SIGNS BY WHICH A SOCERRER IS IDENTIFIED:

If one of these following signs are found in a curer then he/she is a
sorcerer without a doubt.

1\. Asks the affected person for his name and his mother\'s name.

2\. Demand something from the belongings of patient, like his dress,
shirt etc.

3\. Writes talismans.(what is it )

are letters or numbers.

7\. He murmurs with words which cannot be understood.

8\. The patient is given pages to be burnt or incensed with.

**SOOTHSAYING, AND FORTUNE TELLING (Alkahaanah Wa Alarraafah)**

Definition:

SOOTHSAYER (Kaahin): The one who informs about the future by the help of
Jinns and Satans.

FORTUNE TELLER (Arraaf): Someone who claims to have knowledge of present
things like the location of stolen items and lost goods or animals etc,
by ways which are hidden/unknown.

Claiming to know the unseen:

This can amount to disbelief as it denies the Quran, Allah says: \"Say,
\"None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except Allah,\"
(An-Naml:65)

Types of people who inform about the unseen.

1\. One who informs about the future through Jinns, this person is known
as Kaahin (Soothsayer).

2\. One who informs about the unseen through steps/marks on the land,
this person is called a Rammaal (Geomancer).

3\. Who informs about the unseen through stars, this person is called
Munjim (Astrologer).

4\. Who informs about the location of stolen items by hidden ways, this
person is called Arraaf (Fortune Teller).

Ruling on going to these people

1\. One who goes to them, asking questions/help, but doesn\'t believe in
them:

This is forbidden, it\'s from Major sins and the prayer (salah) of such
person won\'t be accepted for 40 days.

EVIDENCE: The prophet said ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) : "Whoever goes to a
fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayer will not be
accepted for forty days." (Meaning he won't get any rewards for praying
them.) Narrated by Muslim (2230).

2\. One who goes to them asking something and believes in them:

He has disbelieved at what was revealed to Muhammad ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}).

EVIDENCE: The prophet said ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) :

"Whoever goes to a soothsayer or fortune teller and believes in what he
says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad."( Abu
Dawood).

**ORNITHOLOGY (ALTIYARAH)**

Definition-

Linguistic: Taken from \"Tatayyur\" meaning being optimistic or
pessimistic about a thing.

ISLAMIC LAW: Evil omen/Pessimism which happens because of something
being looked at, heard, or known about.

It\'s ruling-

Seeking an evil omen contradicts Tawheed in two ways :

1\. The reliance/trust of a pessimist person on Allah is broken and he
relies on other than Allah.

2\. His attachment is to something which has no reality, rather it is
just an imagination/assumption.

Evidence for its imperssibility:

But when good came to them, they said, "This is ours \[by right\].". And
if a bad \[condition\] struck them, they saw an evil omen in Moses and
those with him. Unquestionably, their fortune is with Allah, but most of
them do not know. ":Al-A\'raf:131).

Allah\'s Messenger ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) said, \'(There is) no \'Adwa, nor is
there any bad omen (from birds), nor is there any Hamah, nor is there
any bad omen in the month of Safar,(Sahih Al-Bukhari)

And His saying ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) : "AlTiyarah is shirk". Narrated by abu
Dawood and Tirmidhi.

Traits of a pessimist:

1\. He gives up/submits and responds to these evil omens and leaves
action, this is from the biggest forms of evil omens.

2\. He carries on, not leaving actions but is anxious/worried and fears
the effect of the evil omen. This form is less serious than the first
one.

Both of the above are a deficiency in Tawheed and such believes harm
people.

Remedy for the evil omen --

Saying the dua: " O Allah You Alone bring good things, You Alone avert
evil things, and there is no might or power but in You." (Abu Dawood)

Saying the dua: (O Allaah, there is no good except Your good, no birds
(omens) except from You, and there is no god beside You)

"To say: Allaahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka
wa laa ilaaha ghayruka.( Narrated by Ahmed and authenticated by Albaani)

Upon such person is also:

1\. Realising the harm of evil omens

2\. Struggling with one's soul (in repelling these omens and not action
on them)

3\. Believing in the divine decree

4\. Thinking good about Allah and

5\. Doing Istikhaarah

The prophet said ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}):

\"At-Tiyarah is that which causes you to carry something (an action) out
or that turns you back (from your mission).\"

(Musnad Ahmad)

(Al-Fa\'l) good omens

Meaning: It\'s a good word that a person hears and regards it as a good
potent.

EXAMPLE: A person intends a journey and hears someone call out \"O
Saalim (the one who is safe)\" and takes it as good sign.

RULING: Permissible

EVIDENCE: Saying of the prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) : \"but I like
optimism." They said, "What is optimism?" He said, "A good word." 

Difference Between At-Tiyarah (evil omen) and Al-Fa\'l (good omen)

AT-TIYARAH: Is having an evil thought about Allah, it\'s giving Allahs
right to someone else, and it\'s attachment of the heart with someone
other than Allah who neither benefit nor harm.

AL-FA\'L: Good thoughts about Allah, It doesn\'t stop a person from what
he is going to do.

**ASTROLOGY (TANJEEM)**

DEFINITION

LINGUISTIC: learning about the knowledge of stars or believing in the
influence of stars

ISLAMIC LAW: Using (the position of) starts to deduce (rulings) on
specific things.

TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE OF STARS

1\. KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO RULINGS AND INFLUENCE

A: Believing that the starts themselves (alone) have influence (over
something), this is Major Shirk.

B: Making starts as means for claiming to know the knowledge of unseen,
this is Major Disbelief

C: Believing that the stars are the reason for the occurrence of good
and evil however Allah is the causer (one who Allows it) , this is
prohibited and is a Minor Shirk

2\. KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO MEANS AND DIRECTIONS

A: Using the movement of starts for the benefit of religious affairs
like finding Qiblah, this is desirable (allowed).

B: Using movement of starts for the benefit of worldly affairs, this is
permissible. Like using starts for finding directions

C: Using the stars to determine seasons.

WISDOM BEHIND CREATION OF STARTS

1\. They are a glorification for the heavens

2\. They are missiles for the Shayateen

3\. They are signs to be used as guidance for directions

**ASKING FOR RAIN FROM STARS ( ALISTISQAA)**

ISTISQA\' means asking for rain.

ALANWAA is the plural of Alnauw, which means level/position of a star.
There are 28 levels in total.

Intended from it:

Attributing rain to the levels of the stars.

 

It\'s types-

1\. MAJOR SHIRK:

A: When the stars are asked/supplicated for rain.

"they used to say: "Oh such and such (level of ) star send us rain" etc

B: When the rain is attributed to these stars, believing they are the
ones who caused the rain instead of Allah, even if one doesn\'t
supplicate to them.

2\. MINOR SHIRK:

When they are considered as the means only and Allah being the causer.

3\. PERMISSIBLE:

When they are only considered to be the signs, not means nor attributing
the rain to the stars themselves.

Evidence for its prohibition:

Saying of Allah: " And instead of (Thanking Allah) for the provision He
gives you, on the contrary, you deny Him (by disbelief)! Surah Waqiah
verse 82

(Commenting on the above verse, Mujaahid said: " the denial here refers
to there belief of saying we received rain because of such and such
star")

Hadith of the prophet: "Do you know what your Rubb has said?\" They
replied: \"Allah and His Messenger know better.\" Upon this he remarked,
\"He has said: \'Some of My slaves have entered the morning as My
believers and some as unbelievers. He who said: We have had a rainfall
due to the Grace and Mercy of Allah, believes in Me and disbelieves in
the stars; and he who said: We have had a rainfall due to the rising of
such and such star, disbelieves in Me and affirms his faith in the
stars.\"\'

Agreed upon

**OSTENTATION /SHOWING OFF (ALRIYAA)**

Definition-

LINGUISTIC: Displaying something for someone so that they can see it.

ISLAMIC LAW: Displaying obedience (worship) for others, (intending it)
to be seen and praised by people.

It\'s ruling-

1\. If the Riya\' is slight/small (in amount) : Minor Shirk.

2\. If the whole deed or major portion of it is Riya\' : Major Shirk.

This does not occur from a true believer rather it is a quality of a
hypocrite.

It\'s dangers-

1\. It\'s Minor Shirk.

The prophet said ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) : The thing I fear for you the most is
lesser shirk (Riyaa) Narrated by ahmed

2\. A person involved in it won\'t be forgiven unless he repents.

Allah says: "Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him
˹in worship˺ but forgives anything else of whoever He wills." AlNisa- 48

This includes minor as well as major shirk (according the opinion held
by the author).

3\. The deed becomes useless when affected/mixed with Riya\'.

Evidence:

The prophet said ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}): Allah said: I am so self-sufficient
that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action
for someone else's sake as well as Mine will have that action renounced
by Me to him whom he associated with Me. (Muslim)

4\. It\'s greater than the trial of Dajjal

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came out to us when we were discussing Dajjal
(False Christ) and said: 'Shall I not tell you of that which I fear more
for you than Dajjal?' We said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Hidden polytheism, when
a man stands to pray and makes it look good because he sees a man
looking at him.'" Narrated by ahmad.

**WHEN A DEED IS AFFECTED WITH RIYA**

**It has tree conditions:**

**1.When the motive of doing the deed from the beginning itself was to
show off. This is considered Shirk, and that act of worship is
nullified.**

**2. When the deed was intended for Allah and then (effects of) Riya\'
appeared on him.**

This has two outcomes:

A: If one struggles with his soul (to repel it), doesn\'t submit to it
and doesn\'t let it settle in, then the Riya\' which appeared won\'t
affect the deed.

B: If he submits to Riya and doesn't make any effort to ward it off.

The ruling of the act worship here is:

1\. If that deed is such that the beginning of the deed is not dependent
on its ending like giving charity then, only the deed which is affected
by Riyaa is invalid. Like a person who gives 100 riyals in charity and
he is sincere in that act. Then he saw a person and spent a 100 more,
this time to show off. The first deed is valid and the second one is
not.

2\. If that deed is such that the beginning of the deed is dependent on
its ending like Salah, then in this case the entire deed is Nullified
because of Riya entering it. Like a person who stood up to pray two
units of prayer for Allah, the second unit got effected by Riyaa and he
did not strive against it and submitted to it. In this case the whole
act of worship ( two units of prayer) is invalid.

**3. If Riya appears after the performance of the deed -**

1\. It doesn\'t affect the deed in any way.

Note: Whoever hears people praising him and becomes happy then there is
no blame on him as is mentioned in the Hadith : \"This is the glad
tidings which a believer receives (in this life).\" (Muslim).

Note: Leaving a deed for the sake of people also contributes to Riya.

The difference between riya\' and suma\'h

Riya\': This is related to looking, meaning doing a deed to be seen by
people and praised.

Suma\'h: This is related to hearing, meaning doing a deed so that it can
be heard by people and praised.

The remedy for Riyaa

1\. Remembering the virtues of sincerity.

2\. Remembering the dangers of riya and that it nullifies the deed.

3\. Remembering the Hereafter.

4\. Knowing that people neither benefit nor harm except by the will of
Allah.

5\. Making dua. From the duas we can make is saying "O Allah, I seek
refuge with You lest I should commit shirk with You knowingly and I seek
Your forgiveness for what I do unknowingly."

**WHEN A DEED IS AFFECTED WITH RIYA**

**When the deed was intended for Allah and then (effects of) Riya\'
appeared on a person.**

**When the motive of doing the deed from the beginning itself is to show
off**

**If Riya appears after the performance of the deed**

**It doesn\'t affect the deed in any way.**

**This is considered Shirk, and that act of worship is nullified.**

**If one submits to Riya and doesn't make any effort to ward it off.**

**If one struggles with the soul (to repel it), doesn\'t submit to it
and doesn\'t let it settle in**

**If that deed is such that the beginning of the deed is dependent on
its ending like Salaah**

**If that deed is such that the beginning of the deed is not dependent
on its ending like giving charity (multiple times)**

**Riya\' which appeared won\'t affect the deed.**

**then only the deed which is affected by Riyaa is invalid**

**then in this case the entire deed is Nullified.**

**A PERSON INTENDING DUNYA THROUGH HIS/HER WORSHIP**

It means: That a person performs an act of worship solely to acquire
some worldly benefit through it.

Examples:

1\. Making Hajj to acquire wealth.

2\. To fight for the sake of taking the war booty.

3\. Giving adhaan for receiving wages.

4\. To seek Islamic knowledge only for the sake of getting a
certificate, job or a position.

Ruling:

1\. If the major portion or all his deeds are done seeking worldly gains
then this is Major Shirk.

2\. If only a specific deed is done seeking some worldly benefits, then
this is Minor Shirk which invalidates the deed.

Warning from such an act :

Saying of Allah: \"Whoever desires the life of this world and its
adornments - We fully repay them for their deeds therein, and they
therein will not be deprived.

Those are the ones for whom there is not in the Hereafter but the Fire.
And lost is what they did therein, and worthless is what they used to
do.\" (Hud:15,16).

The prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) said: A person who acquires religious
knowledge, which should be acquired to gain the pleasure of Allah, for
the sole reason of securing worldly comforts will not even smell the
fragrance of Jannah on the Day of Resurrection. Narrated by Ahmed and
Abu daawood.

**TAKING AN OATH (ALHALF) BY OTHER THAN ALLAH**

Definition:

LINGUISTIC: Adherence to something.

ISLAMIC LAW: Stressing upon a matter by mentioning The Honoured (Allah)
along with a letter from the letter\'s of oath. The letters of oath in
Arabic are three: waaw, yaa, and taa.

It is also termed as Al-Yameen and Al-Qasam.

Legislated oath:

That which is:

1\. Taken by using the name Allah like: (Wallahi, Billahi, Tallahi).

2\. Taken by using any name from His many names like: (War-Rahman,
War-Raheem)

3\. Taken by using His Attributes like saying: By His honour or by His
mercy etc.

Prohibited oath:

It is swearing by other than Allah.

It\'s of two types:

1\. MAJOR SHIRK: When the one by whom the oath is taken by is venerated
in a manner which is due to Allah or more.

2\. MINOR SHIRK: When there is veneration in the oath but not in a
manner which is due to Allah.

3\. EVIDENCE: The Prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) said: "Whoever swears by
anything other than Allaah is guilty of kufr or shirk." (Narrated by
Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi).

Examples:

1\. Swearing by the pious people.

2\. Swearing by the honour of the Prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) or by the
honour of the pious people.

3\. Swearing by the honour of people.

4\. Taking an oath by nobility and honesty/trustworthiness.

Beneficial points to know:

1\. Prohibition of swearing by other than Allah as it is Shirk.

2\. Prohibition of swearing by Allah while lying, and this is called
Gamoos.

3\. Prohibition of swearing excessively by Allah without a need even if
it is true, as it is belittling Allah The Most High.

4\. Permissibility of taking an oath by Allah during need.

Compensation for the prohibited oath.

The person should say Laa Ilaha Illa Allah as Allah\'s Messenger
([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) said: \"Whoever amongst you swears, (saying by error)
in his oath \'By Al-Lat and Al- Uzza\', then he should say, \'None has
the right to be worshipped but Allah. (Agreed upon)

**SHIRK BY USING WORD \"AND\"**

MEANING

Using the word \"and\" to show a connection between Allah and someone
else in a matter in which the creation has a role in its occurrence.

EXAMPLES:

1\. Saying whatever Allah wishes \"and\" you wish

2\. My hope is in Allah \"and\" you

3\. I seek help from Allah \"and\" you

4\. I don't have anyone except Allah and you.

5\. If it was not because of Allah and someone, I would have perished.
Etc

RULING

1\. If the person really believes in the equalization, then this is
Major Shirk even if the person uses "thumma" (like saying I seek help
from Allah and "then" you)

2\. If not then this is minor shirk

CORRECT APPROACH

1\. To use the word \"then\" instead, like saying : "What Allah wishes
"then" what you wish , without believing in equalization.

2\. A person returns all the affairs to Allah, like saying whatever
Allah wishes alone, my hope is in Allah only etc. This is a better and
more virtuous approach.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USING \"AND & THEN\" IN SUCH SCENARIOS:

\"And\" denotes equalization while \"then\" denotes following up or
subordination.

**THE WORD \"IF\"**

**Using "if" has three scenarios:**

1\. Permissible:

When \"if\" is used for giving information like saying - if you had
attended the class, you would have benefitted.

Evidence: Allah\'s Messenger ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) said, \"If I had formerly
known what I came to know recently, I would not have driven the
sacrificial animals with me\..... (Sahih al-Bukhari 7229)

2\. Recommend:

When \"if\" is used to wish for something good like saying : "if I had
money I would have given it in charity".

Evidence: The prophet said in one hadith about the fourth type of person
that he says, \"If I had wealth, then I would do the deeds of so-and-so
with it.\" (Jami\` at-Tirmidhi 2325)

3\. Impermissible:

In three instances:

1\. When used for objecting something from the Shariah

Evidence: "If they had been guided by us they would not have been
slain." Al Imran verse 168

2\. When used for objecting or blaming Qadr.

Evidence: "If they had been (here) with us they would not have died or
been killed" Al Imran verse 156

3\. When used for wishing something evil.

Evidence: The prophet said in one hadith about a person whom Allah does
not provide with wealth nor knowledge, so he says: " If I had wealth,
then I would do the deeds of so-and -so with it. He has his intention,
so their sin is the same." Tirmidhi.

**CURSING TIME (DAHR)**

Meaning : cursing , criticizing, scolding or rebuking DAHR which means
time and era.

Ruling:

It has three categories:

1\. Permissible: Doing it with the intention of just giving information
like saying: "We got tired due to the severity of heat today."

Like the saying of Lut Peace be upon him: "This is a very hard day"
Surah Hud verse 77

2\. Major Shirk: Cursing time because of believing that it (is the one
that) turns the matters from good to evil.

3\. Major Sin: Cursing time because of it being the period whereby evil
occurs while believing that Allah is the one which turns good into evil.

Hadith

Allah\'s Messenger ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) said, \"Allah said, \"The son of
Adan hurts Me by abusing the Dahr (Time), and I am the Dahr; in My Hands
are the night and the day."! ( Sahih al-Bukhari )

**Note**: AlDahr is not from the beautiful name of Allah.

**TWO PRINCIPLES FOR SPEAKING**

1\. OBLIGATION OF PROTECTING THE TONGUE FROM SPEAKING HARAAM like
backbiting, tale bearing, lying, and swearing by other than Allah

This is because a person is accountable for whatever he or she utters.
Allah says "Man does not utter any word except that with him is an
observer prepared \[to record\]." Surah Qaf verse 18

A person may leave the fold of Islam by uttering a single word, thus it
is extremely important to guard the words which come out ones mouth.

2\. WORDS WHICH MAY CARRY MEANINGS OF SHIRK

It is not permissible to use to use such words, because using them may
lead one to commit shirk or become a pathway to commit shirk.

**INNOVATION (BIDAH)**

Definition:

LINGUISTIC: A thing which is invented, not having any examples like it
before.

ISLAMIC LAW: Whatever is invented in the religion without any evidence.

Types:

1\. Innovations in habits and customs, like modern inventions: These are
permissible because the ruling on customs are that they are permissible
(unless there is an evidence proving it to be impermissible)

2\. Innovations in religion (religious acts) : This is prohibited,
because the ruling in religious worship is that it is not permissible
unless there is an evidence for it.

Types of religious innovations

1\. INNOVATION IN BELIEFS: It is any belief which is contrary to what
Allah and His messenger informed like innovation of denying Qadr,
likening Allah to His creation etc.

2\. INNOVATION IN ACTIONS: It is to worship by other than what is
legislated in the religion like:

\(A\) Inventing a new worship which is not legislated

\(B\) Increasing or decreasing anything in the legislated worship

\(C\) To perform a legislated worship in an innovated (new) way

\(D\) Specifying a time for a legislated worship which is not restricted
by the Shariah

Some examples of above include:

Raising the graves ( by building on them ), celebrating or taking part
in innovated festivals etc.

3.INNOVATION OF ABANDONING: Meaning abandoning a permissible deed
considering it to be worship, like abandoning marriage and considering
it as worship.

Catergorization of innovation in terms of rulings

1\. Innovation of Disbelief(kufr): Makes a person leave the fold of
islam.

Examples: denial/refusing to believe (shia), and saying the quran is
created

2\. Innovation of disobedience: Makes a person sinful but doesn't put
him out of the fold of islam.

Examples: Congregational remembrance, singling out 15^th^ of Shabaan for
specific worship.

Warning against innovation:

Enough as an admonition is this verse and the two ahaadith:

"This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour
upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion." surah Maaidah
verse 3

They saying of the prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) peace be upon him: "He who
innovates something in this matter of ours that is not of it will have
it rejected." (Agreed upon). In another narration : ""Whoever does an
act that is not in accord with our matter will have it rejected."
(Muslim)

The prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) said: "The worst of things are those that
are newly invented; every newly-invented thing is an innovation and
every innovation is going astray, and every going astray is in the Fire"

Narrated by Muslim and Nasai.

**Is there something known as good innovation:** ?

Whosoever categorized innovation into:

1\. Good

2\. Bad

Then such a person is mistaken because the prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"})
clearly said "every innovation is misguidance". Thus the prophet clearly
ruled every innovation as misguidance and this person is saying that
there is such an innovation which good.

Reasons for the appearance of innovation:

1\. Ignorance about religious rulings.

2\. Following one's desires.

3\. Fanaticism towards opinions and men.

4\. Imitating the disbelievers.

5\. Relying on fabricated ahaadith having no basis.

6\. Following customs and myths which have no basis in the religion and
make no sense.

Two important principles:

1\. The basic rule in any act of worship is \"refraining\" until
evidence for its permissibility is established.

2\. Every worship acting on which was necessary and the caller towards
it was present during the time of the prophet peace be upon him, any
deed which was not performed by the prophet and his noble companions
shows that it is not legislated to perform that act.

Two important points:

1\. Imam Maalik said: Whosoever comes with an innovation in the religion
considering it as good, it is as if he claims that the prophet was
disloyal in his message (of spreading the truth). Because Allah says:
""This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour
upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion." surah Maaidah
verse 3

2\. Shiekh Albany said: It is crucial that we know that even a smallest
innovation which a person comes up with is prohibited, and it is not
like what some people think that innovation is on the level of being
makrooh (disliked) only.

**SOME WIDESPREAD INNOVATIONS**

1\. Celebrating the birthday of the prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) and other
birthdays.

2\. Celebrating the night of Isra and Miraaj

3\. Celebrating the night of mid shabaan

4\. Seeking blessings from places and remnants or people alive or dead.

5\. Making zikr in congregation

6\. Asking to recite Surah Faatihah on the souls of the dead and in the
gatherings

7\. Speaking of niyah out loud before the prayer

8\. Singling out the month of Rajab for Umrah and specific worship

9\. Tawassul by the right and honour of people.

Some helpful books about understanding Bidah

1\. "Altahzeer min albidah" by Shiekh Bin Baaz

2\. "Alsunan walmubtadiaat" by Shiekh Muhammad Abdussalam Alqushayri

3\. "Albidu walmuhdathaat wa maa laa asla lahu" Jamu wa iidaad : humud
almatar

4\. "Alibdaau fil mudaari alibtidaa" by sheikh Ali Mahfooz

5\. "Albidu alhawliyyah" by Shiekh Abdullah Tuwaijiri

Benefit:

"Following" is not established except if the deed is in harmony with the
shariah in six things :

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **No.**   **Condition**   **Examples of not meeting the condition**
  --------- --------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  1\.       Reason          Like someone prayer two units of prayer because it
                            rained

  2\.       Category/Kind   Like someone giving zakat alFitr in cash

**CALLING TOWARDS TAWHEED**

Calling towards Allah has great significance and enormous virtues. It is
the role of the Prophets and the messengers and the domain of pious and
people who are near to Allah.

Allah says: "Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good
instruction and argue with them in a way that is best." Surah Nahl verse
25

He also says: "This is my way; I invite to Allah with insight, I and
those who follow me." Surah Yusuf verse 108

The prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) said : "By Allah, if a single person is
guided by Allah through you, it will be better for you than a whole lot
of red camels." Agreed upon.

The prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) also said: "He who calls others to follow
the right guidance will have a reward equal to the reward of those who
follow him, without their reward being diminished in any respect on that
account." Narrated by Muslim

TAWHEED SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING TO CALL TOWARDS.

The first thing which is obligatory to teach, make understand, spread,
and call towards is Tawheed.

Evidence: Hadith of the prophet ([ﷺ]{dir="rtl"}) : \"So let the first
thing to which you will invite them, be the Tawheed of Allah.\" (Sahih
Al-Bukhari)

From the means of calling towards Tawheed are:

1\. Printing books and pamphlets which call towards Tawheed and sharing
them.

2\. Sharing islamic content (audios and videos) which call towards
tawheed.

3\. People who are capable should deliver islamic speeches and sermons
about Tawheed

4\. Teaching ones children and family about the foundations of Tawheed
and books of Aqeedah.

5\. Dialoguing with businessmen to provide monetary aid in publishing
and spreading the books of Tawheed.
